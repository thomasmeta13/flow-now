Acknowledgements

My understanding of the Buddhist tradition owes much to many.
Some of what is owed and to whom is apparent from the notes
and bibliography of the present volume, but some deserve spe-
cial mention. To Lance Cousins, who first introduced me to
Buddhism, I owe a special debt. A number of people have read
drafts of parts of this book during the course of its writing;
to Lance Cousins, Hugh Gethin, Michael Houser, Rita Langer,
Ken Robinson, Alexander von Rospatt, Ornan Rotem, Gregory
Schopen, and Paul Williams I am especially grateful for their com-
ments, criticisms, and encouragement. I am also grateful to my
students and all those others whose questions and puzzled faces
have prompted me to try to express what I understand of Bud-
dhism more clearly. Finally a word of thanks to my editor at OUP,
George Miller, for his patience and help.

A Note on Buddhist Languages

The original language of Buddhist thought is problematic. It was
not Sanskrit (Old Indo-Aryan) but a closely related Middle
Indo-Aryan dialect similar to Pali, the canonical language of the
Buddhism of Sri Lanka and South-East Asia. As Buddhism
developed in ancient India it tended increasingly to speak the
universal language of ancient Indian culture, Sanskrit. Sub-
sequently Buddhist texts were translated into Chinese and
Tibetan which became major Buddhist languages in their own
right.

The general principle I have adopted is to quote universal
Buddhist terms in both Sanskrit and (when there is a difference)
Pali, placed in parentheses after the English translation so:
‘aggregates’ (skandha/khandha). If the term is used again in the
body of the text I have generally preferred the Sanskrit form,
unless the context is exclusively that of Theravada Buddhism.
Terms that are specific or characteristic of a particular Buddhist
tradition are quoted in the appropriate language(s), either Pali
or Sanskrit with, where appropriate, their Chinese or Tibetan,
or occasionally their Japanese or Korean translation.

The transliteration of Indian languages follows the standard
transliteration scheme (see A. L. Basham, The Wonder that Was
India, 506-8); Chinese is quoted according to the Wade-—Giles
system, rather than Pin-Yin, Tibetan according to the Wylie
system. Words that have become part of the English language
(i.e. would be found in an English dictionary) are left unitalicized
but the appropriate diacritical marks have been added, hence
‘nirvana’.

Introduction

The term ‘Buddhism’ refers to a vast and complex religious and
philosophical tradition with a history that stretches over some
2,500 years, taking in, at one time or another, the greater part of
Asia, from Afghanistan and parts of Persia in the west to Japan
in the east, from the great islands of Sumatra and Java in the
south to Mongolia and parts of southern Russia in the north. As
one writer reminds us, over half the world’s population today
lives in areas where Buddhism has at one time or another been
the dominant religious influence.’ Living Buddhism divides into
three broad traditions:

1. The Theravada tradition of Sri Lanka and South-East Asia,
also sometimes referred to as ‘southern’ Buddhism. Its canon-
ical scriptures are preserved in Pali, an ancient Indian language
closely related to Sanskrit. The school exemplifies a certain con-
servatism. Relative to the other two traditions, it can be regarded
as generally closer in doctrine and practice to ancient Buddhism
as it existed in the early centuries Bc in India. Today it is the
religious tradition followed by a population of over 100 million
in Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos.

2. The East Asian tradition of China, Korea, Japan, and Viet-
nam, also sometimes referred to as ‘eastern’ Buddhism. Its scrip-
tures are preserved in Chinese and its general outlook is that of
the Mahayana or ‘Great Vehicle’, a movement of ancient Indian
Buddhist thought and practice that from about the beginning of
the Christian era dubbed those who did not adopt its overall vision
of Buddhism—represented today by the Theravada—followers
of the ‘Lesser Vehicle’ (hinaydna). East Asian Buddhism is
extremely diverse; it has coexisted with Confucianism, Taoism,

2 Introduction

Shintd, and, more recently but less happily, Communism; it
remains a significant religious tradition for a population of 500
million to 1,000 million.

3. The Tibetan tradition, also sometimes referred to as ‘north-
ern’ Buddhism. Its scriptures are preserved in Tibetan and once
more its outlook is broadly that of the Mahayana, but its more
specific orientation is that of the ‘Vehicle of the Diamond Thun-
derbolt’ (vajra-yana), also known as Tantric Buddhism. Today
it is the religious tradition followed by 10 million to 20 million,
principally in Tibet and Mongolia, but also in parts of Nepal and
Himalayan India.

All three of these traditions look back to ancient Buddhism and
the land of India, where Buddhism was born but whence it vir-
tually disappeared over five centuries ago.

The present volume was conceived as an introduction to
Buddhist thought and practice, and is intended to be accessible
to the reader with no previous knowledge of Buddhism. Given
its great diversity and its long history, the task of introducing
Buddhism is a daunting one. As is fashionable to point out these
days, ‘Buddhism’ is something of an intellectual abstraction: in
reality there is not one Buddhism but many Buddhisms. Any writer
of an introductory text to Buddhism is faced with the problem
of how to do justice to the richness and diversity of Buddhism
both past and present. Most of the existing introductory volumes
to Buddhism offer their readers some kind of general survey
of the different ‘Buddhisms’, and attempt to give an equal and
balanced treatment of all that Buddhism has been and still is.
The advantage of this approach is that, ideally if not always in
practice, it avoids the pitfall of seeming to imply that one or other
form of Buddhism represents a ‘truer’ form of Buddhism than
others, or that one has somehow captured the real essence of
Buddhism. Its disadvantage is that, in a volume of some 300 pages,
one is in danger of saying very little about an awful lot, and of
presenting the reader with what amounts to a catalogue of dates,
people, places, doctrines, and practices; a reader may finish such
a book, yet somehow know very little of Buddhism. For this

Introduction 3

reason it seems worth while trying to introduce Buddhism in a
more explicitly focused way.

The approach I have adopted in the present volume, then, is
to try to identify and focus on those fundamental ideas and prac-
tices that constitute something of a common heritage shared by
the different traditions of Buddhism that exist in the world
today. Of course, the precise nature of that common heritage is
open to question. Nevertheless, the fact remains that the areas
of Buddhist thought and practice outlined in the present volume
—the story of the Buddha (Chapter 1), a textual and scriptural
tradition (Chapter 2), the framework of the four noble truths
(Chapter 3), the monastic and lay ways of life (Chapter 4), a cos-
mology based around karma and rebirth (Chapter 5), the teach-
ing of no self and dependent arising (Chapter 6), a progressive
path of practice leading on from good conduct and devotions
through stages of meditation to a higher understanding (Chap-
ter 7), the theoretical systems of either the Abhidharma or the
Madyamaka and Yogiacara (Chapters 8 and 9), the path of the
bodhisattva (Chapter 9)—are all, in one way or another, assumed
by and known to all Buddhism. These are the foundations upon
which Buddhism rests.

Of course, I do not mean to suggest by this that a Buddhist
layman in Tokyo and a Buddhist laywoman in Bangkok, that
a monk in Colombo and a nun in Lhasa, would all respond to
questions on these topics precisely along the lines set out in the
relevant chapters below. None the less, it is not unreasonable
nor, I think, is it to commit oneself to an essentialist view of
Buddhism to suggest that, whatever the nature of the Buddhist
terrain, one cannot dig much below the surface without coming
across some trace of the patterns of thought and practice out-
lined here, even if at different times and in different places
the constructions built on their foundations present their own
distinctive and peculiar aspects. Moreover, the fact that those
patterns of thought and practice are not immediately apparent
does not of itself mean that they exert no influence. That we may
not always be consciously aware of particular ideas and theories,
or that we may be unable to articulate them in detail, does not

4 Introduction

mean that those ideas fail to affect our view of the world. The
principles of, say, Newtonian physics, Darwinian evolutionary
theory, and Freudian psychology contribute to a world-view that
is shared by many who have never read a word of what Newton,
Darwin, or Freud wrote and would be hard pressed to explain
in detail any of their ideas.

I should, however, add that I have not entirely eschewed the
general-survey approach; Chapter 9, on specifically Mahayana
ideas, and especially Chapter 10, an overview of the history of
the different traditions of Buddhism in Asia, are intended to give
some indication of what I have not covered and provide some
form of orientation for further study.

Apart from its simply allowing a more sustained account of
some significant aspects of Buddhist thought and practice, there
is a further reason why I think focusing on the common heritage
as indicated above is appropriate at the introductory level: it affords
a perspective on the development of Buddhist thought and prac-
tice which calls into question what might be dubbed the standard
‘textbook’ view and is in fact more in tune with recent scholar-
ship. This textbook view tends to see the history of Buddhism in
terms of a division into two major ‘sects’: the Theravada and the
Mahayana. More specifically, according to this ‘textbook’ view,
in origin the Mahayana was at once a popular religious protest
against the élitist monasticism of early Buddhism and a philo-
sophical refutation of its dead-end scholasticism; moreover, this
religious protest and philosophical refutation rapidly all but
marginalized earlier forms of Buddhism. The research published
in the last twenty years or so has increasingly made such a
view of the development of Indian Buddhist thought and prac-
tice untenable. The Mahayana did not originate as a clearly
defined ‘sect’ and, far from being a popular lay movement, it seems
increasingly likely that it began as a minority monastic move-
ment and remained such for several hundred years, down to at
least the fifth century ce. Moreover, what is becoming clearer is
that many elements of Buddhist thought and practice that were
once thought to be characteristic of the emerging Mahayana
were simply developments within what has been called by some

Introduction 5

‘mainstream’ Buddhism;? and while the Mahayana certainly
criticized aspects of mainstream Buddhist thought and practice,
much more was taken as said and done, and just carried over.
Thus, instead of seeing Mahay4na as simply superseding earlier
forms of Buddhism in India, the approach adopted in the pre-
sent volume is to try to focus on the common ground between
the non-Mahayana and Mahayana in the formative phase of
Indian Buddhist thought and practice, and by referring to both
the Pali sources of Sri Lanka and the Sanskrit sources of north-
ern India to present an outline of ‘mainstream’ Buddhist thought
and practice as the foundations for developments in India and
beyond. Such an approach, then, does tend to privilege what is
ancient, but throughout I have attempted to give some indica-
tion of how these basic principles of Buddhist thought and prac-
tice might relate to more recent developments.

Let me add here a few words on my specific approach to my
material. In describing Buddhist thought and practice, my aim
has been, in the first place, simply to act as spokesman for its
principles, and to try to articulate those principles as Buddhist
tradition itself has understood them. In the second place, I have
tried to give some indication of and pass some comment on the
critical and scholarly issues that have emerged in the modern aca-
demic study of Buddhism over the last 150 years or so.

Some might question the need for yet another introductory
volume on Buddhism, yet as a teacher of introductory courses
on Buddhism at a university I find myself somewhat dissatisfied
with the available teaching materials. Certainly there are avail-
able a number of survey-type books ranging from short and
sketchy to more moderate-sized treatments. In addition there
are some solid introductions to various aspects of Buddhism
—the social history of Theravada, Mahayana thought, Chinese
Buddhism, Tibetan Buddhism—but if one looks for a volume
giving a more focused account, reflecting recent scholarship, of
what, for want of a better expression, one might refer to as the
principles of ‘mainstream’ Buddhist thought and practice, there
appears to be a gap. It is hoped that the present work will go
some way to filling that gap.

6 Introduction

In sum, what distinguishes the present volume is that it con-
tains rather more sustained expositions of Buddhist cosmology,
no self and dependent arising, the path of meditation, and the
theoretical Abhidharma framework (which underlies all later
Buddhist thought) than other introductory books. Thus there
is material here which, although basic from a Buddhist point of
view, is only available in specialized books and articles. I hope,
then, that while the book is intended to be accessible to the nov-
ice, there may also be something here for the elders of Buddhist
studies.

The Buddha
The Story of the Awakened One

The historical Buddha

In January 1898 an Englishman, W. C. Peppé, digging into a mound
on his estate at Piprahwa just the Indian side of the Indian-
Nepalese border, unearthed a soapstone vase some six inches
in height with a brief inscription around its lid. The inscription,
written in the Brahmi script and dating from about the second
century BCE, was in one of the ancient Indian dialects or Prakrits
collectively referred to as Middle Indo-Aryan. The precise inter-
pretation of the inscription remains problematic, but it appears
to claim that the vase is ‘a receptacle of relics of the Blessed Buddha
of the Sakyas’.! The circumstances of this find and the find itself
actually reveal a considerable amount about the nature and long
history of what we know today as ‘Buddhism’.

Peppé was among the early excavators of ruined Buddhist stiipas
or monumental burial mounds. Such stiipas vary considerably in
size. The largest were made to enshrine the relics of the Buddha
himself or of Buddhist ‘saints’ or arhats (Pali arahat), while
smaller ones contained the remains of more ordinary men and
women.” Today countless stupas are to be found scattered across
the Indian subcontinent (where over the past hundred years a
few have been restored to something of their former glory) and
also other countries where Buddhism spread. Buddhism was,
then, in origin an Indian phenomenon. Beginning in the fifth cen-
tury BCE, its teachings and institutions continued to flourish for
some fifteen centuries on Indian soil, inspiring and moulding
the intellectual, religious, and cultural life of India. During this
period Buddhism spread via the old trade routes far beyond the

8 The Buddha

confines of India right across Asia, from Afghanistan in the west
to Japan in the east, affecting and touching the lives of millions
of people. Yet by around the close of the twelfth century Bud-
dhist institutions had all but disappeared from India proper,
and it is in the countries and cultures that lie beyond India that
Buddhism flourishes today. None the less all the various living
traditions of Buddhism in some way look back to and revere a
figure who has a certain basis in history—a figure who lived and
died in northern India several centuries before the beginning of
the Christian era and belonged to a people known as the Sakyas
(Pali Sakya). He is Sakya-muni, ‘the sage of the Sakyas’, or as
our inscription prefers to call him buddho bhagava—‘the Blessed
Buddha’, ‘the Lord Buddha’.

So who, and indeed what, was the Lord Buddha? This is a ques-
tion that might be answered in a number of different ways, a ques-
tion about which both the Buddhist tradition and the historian
have something to say. The nature of the Buddha is a subject
that the Buddhist tradition itself has expounded on at length and
to which we will return below but, in brief, the word buddha
is not a name but a title; its meaning is ‘one who has woken up’.
This title is generally applied by the Buddhist tradition to a class
of beings who are, from the perspective of ordinary humanity,
extremely rare and quite extraordinary. In contrast to these
Buddhas or ‘awakened ones’ the mass of humanity, along with
the other creatures and beings that constitute the world, are
asleep—asleep in the sense that they pass through their lives never
knowing and seeing the world ‘as it is’ (yatha-bhiitam). As a con-
sequence they suffer. A buddha on the other hand awakens to
the knowledge of the world as it truly is and in so doing finds
release from suffering. Moreover—and this is perhaps the great-
est significance of a buddha for the rest of humanity, and indeed
for all the beings who make up the universe—a buddha teaches.
He teaches out of sympathy and compassion for the suffering
of beings, for the benefit and welfare of all beings; he teaches
in order to lead others to awaken to the understanding that
brings final relief from suffering. An ancient formula still used
in Buddhist devotions today puts it as follows:

The Buddha 9

For the following reasons he is a Blessed One: he is an Arhat, a per-
fectly and completely awakened one, perfect in his understanding and
conduct, happy, one who understands the world, an unsurpassed trainer
of unruly men, the teacher of both gods and men, a blessed buddha.’

Such is a buddha in general terms, but what of the particular
buddha with whom we started, whose relics appear to have been
enshrined in a number of stiipas across the north of India and to
whom the Buddhist tradition looks as its particular founder—
the historical Buddha? Let us for the moment consider the ques-
tion not so much from the perspective of the Buddhist tradition
as from the perspective of the historian.

The Buddha and the Indian ‘renouncer’ tradition

We can know very little of the historical Buddha with any degree
of certainty. Yet within the bounds of reasonable historical
probability we can form quite a clear picture of the kind of per-
son the Buddha was and the main events of his life. The oldest
Buddhist sources, which provide us with a number of details con-
cerning the person and life of the Buddha, date from the fourth
or third century sce. Unfortunately when we turn to the non-
Buddhist sources of a similar date, namely the earliest texts of
the Jain and brahmanical traditions, there is no explicit mention
of the Buddha at all.* It would be a mistake to conclude, how-
ever, that non-Buddhist sources thus provide us with no corrob-
orative evidence for the picture of the Buddha painted in early
Buddhist texts. Essentially the latter present the Buddha as a
§ramana (Pali samana). This term means literally ‘one who
strives’ and belongs to the technical vocabulary of Indian reli-
gion, referring as it does to ‘one who strives’ religiously or spir-
itually. It points towards a particular tradition that in one way
or another has been of great significance in Indian religious his-
tory, be it Buddhist, Jain, or Hindu. Any quest for the historical
Buddha must begin with the sramana tradition. Collectively our
sources may not allow us to write the early history of this move-
ment but they do enable us to say a certain amount concerning
its character.

10 The Buddha

The tradition is sometimes called the ‘renouncer (samnydsin)
tradition’. What we are concerned with here is the phenomenon
of individuals’ renouncing their normal role in society as a mem-
ber of an extended ‘household’ in order to devote themselves to
some form of religious or spiritual life. The ‘renouncer’ abandons
conventional means of livelihood, such as farming or trade, and
adopts instead the religious life as a means of livelihood. That
is, he becomes.a religious mendicant dependent on alms. What
our sources make clear is that by the fifth century BCE this phenom-
enon was both widespread and varied. Thus while ‘renouncers’
had in common the fact that they had ‘gone forth from the
household life into homelessness’ (to use a phrase common in
Buddhist sources), the kind of lifestyle they then adopted was
not necessarily the same. This is suggested by some of the terms
that we find in the texts: in addition to ‘one who strives’ and
‘renouncer’, we find ‘wanderer’ (parivrajaka/paribbajaka), ‘one
who begs his share [of alms]’ (bhiksu/bhikkhu), ‘naked ascetic’
(acelaka), ‘matted-hair ascetic’ (jatila), as well as a number of
other terms.° Some of these wanderers and ascetics seem to have
been loners, while others seem to have organized themselves
into groups and lived under a teacher. Early renouncers seem
to have been for the most part male, although with the growth
of Buddhism and Jainism it is certainly the case that women too
began to be numbered among their ranks.

Three kinds of activity seem to have preoccupied these wan-
derers and ascetics. First, there is the practice of austerities,
such as going naked in all weathers, enduring all physical dis-
comforts, fasting, or undertaking the vow to live like a cow or
even a dog.® Secondly, there is the cultivation of meditative and
contemplative techniques aimed at producing what might, for
the lack of a suitable technical term in English, be referred to as
‘altered states of consciousness’. In the technical vocabulary of
Indian religious texts such states come to be termed ‘meditations’
(dhyana/jhana) or ‘concentrations’ (samadhi); the attainment
of such states of consciousness was generally regarded as bring-
ing the practitioner to some deeper knowledge and experience
of the nature of the world. Lastly there is the development of

The Buddha II

various philosophical views providing the intellectual justifica-
tion for particular practices and the theoretical expression of
the ‘knowledge’ to which they led. While some groups and indi-
viduals seem to have combined all three activities, others favoured
one at the expense of the others, and the line between the prac-
tice of austerities and the practice of meditation may not always
be clear: the practice of extreme austerity will certainly alter one’s
state of mind.

The existence of some of these different groups of ancient
Indian wanderers and ascetics with their various practices and
theories finds expression in Buddhist texts in a stock description
of ‘six teachers of other schools’, who are each represented as
expounding a particular teaching and practice. Another list, with
no details of the associated teachings and practices, gives ten types
of renouncer. In fact two other ancient Indian traditions that were
subsequently of some importance in the religious life of India
(the Ajivikas and the Jains) find a place in both these ancient
Buddhist lists; the Jain tradition, of course, survives to this day.”
But one of the most significant groups for the understanding of
the religious milieu of the historical Buddha is omitted from these
lists; this is the early brahmanical tradition. To explain who the
brahmins (brahmana) were requires a brief excursus into the early
evolution of Indian culture and society.

The brahmanical tradition

It is generally thought that some time after the beginning of the
second millennium BcE groups of a nomadic tribal people began
to move south from ancient Iran, through the passes of the
Hindu Kush and down into the plains of the Indus valley. These
people spoke dialects of Old Indo-Aryan, that is, of Sanskrit
and they are known as the Aryas. The Aryas who moved into
India were descendants of nomadic pastoralists who had occu-
pied the grasslands of central Asia, some of whom similarly
moved west into Europe.

Once in India the Aryas’ cultural influence gradually spread
southwards and eastwards across the plains of northern India.
By the time the Buddha was born, probably early in the fifth

century BCE, the Aryas had been in India perhaps a thousand
years and their cultural influence extended down the Ganges
valley as far as Pataliputra (modern Patna). The coming of the
Aryas into India did not bring political unity to northern India,
but it did bring a certain ideology that constitutes one of the prin-
cipal components of Indian culture. This Aryan vision of society
was principally developed and articulated by a hereditary group
within Aryan society known as brahmanas or, in the Anglo-Indian
spelling, brahmins. The original literature of the brahmins is known
as the Vedas, the oldest portions of which, found in the Rg Veda,
date from about 1500 BcE. By the time of the Buddha, Vedic
literature probably already comprised several different classes:
the four collections (samhita) of verses attributed to the ancient
seers (rsi), the ritual manuals (also known as brahmanas) giving
instruction in the carrying out of the elaborate Vedic sacrificial
ritual, and ‘the forest books’ (dranyaka) explaining the esoteric
meaning of this sacrificial ritual. The final class of Vedic liter-
ature, the Upanisads, containing further esoteric explanations
of the sacrificial ritual, was still in the process of formation.
Two aspects of the brahmanical vision are of particular im-
portance, namely an understanding of society as reflecting a
hierarchy of ritual ‘purity’, and a complex system of ritual and
sacrifice. From the brahmanical perspective society comprises two
groups: the Aryas and the non-Aryas. The former consists of the
three hereditary classes (varna) in descending order of purity:
brahmanas (whose prerogative and duty it is to teach and main-
tain the Vedic tradition), ksatriyas or rulers (whose prerogat-
ive and duty is to maintain order and where necessary inflict
appropriate punishment), and the vaisyas (whose prerogative and
duty is to generate wealth through farming and trade). These three
classes are termed ‘twice born’ (dvija) by virtue of the fact that
traditionally male members undergo an initiation (upanayana)
into a period of study of the Vedic tradition under the super-
vision of a brahmin teacher; at the end of this period of study it
is their duty to maintain the household sacrificial fires and, with
the help of brahmins, carry out various sacrificial rituals in accord-
ance with the prescriptions of Vedic tradition. The non-Aryas

The Buddha 13

make up the fourth class, the Siidras or servants, whose basic duty
it is to serve the three other classes. While it is important not to
confuse these four classes (varna) and the countless castes (jati)
of later Indian society, it is none the less the ideology of the relat-
ive ritual purity of the classes that underpins the medieval and
modern Indian ‘caste system’.

The brahmins’ hereditary ritual status empowered them to carry
out certain ritual functions that members of other classes were
excluded from, but at the time of the Buddha not all brahmins
were full-time ‘priests’. Precisely how brahmins related to the
various groups of wandering ascetics is not clear.® In part we can
see the brahmanical vision of society and that of the wandering
ascetics as opposed to each other, in part we can see the two as
complementing each other. To accept the brahmanical view of the
world was to accept brahmanical authority as an aspect of the
eternal structure of the universe and, as such, unassailable. Yet
wandering ascetics threatened brahmanical supremacy by offer-
ing rival visions of the world and society. On the other hand, within
brahmanical circles we find the development of certain esoteric
theories of the nature of the sacrificial ritual and philosophical
views about the ultimate nature of man and his relationship to
the universe at large. These theories may to some extent have
drawn on ideas developing amongst the groups of wandering
ascetics; at the same time they may have substantially con-
tributed to the development of the tradition of the wanderers
itself, since it is clear that brahmin circles were an important recruit-
ing ground for the various groups of wandering ascetics. Yet it
seems clear that in certain respects the Buddha’s teachings were
formulated as a response to certain brahmanical teachings.°

The Buddha and history

It is in this milieu that the historian must understand the his-
torical Buddha as existing. And given this milieu, the bare ‘facts’
of the Buddha’s life as presented by tradition are historically
unproblematic and inconsequential.

The precise dates of the Buddha’s life are uncertain. A wide-
spread Buddhist tradition records that he was in his eightieth

14 The Buddha

year when he died, and the dates for his life most widely quoted
in modern published works are 566-486 BCE. These dates are
arrived at by, first, following a tradition, recorded in the Pali sources
of ‘southern’ Buddhism, that the great Mauryan king, Asoka,
was consecrated 218 years after the death of the Buddha, and,
secondly, taking 268 BcE as the year of Asoka’s accession. This
is done on the basis of the ASokan rock-edict reference to rulers
in the wider Hellenic world who can be dated from other an-
cient sources. But both the figure 218 and the accession of ASoka
in 268 BCE are problematic. In contrast to the southern ‘long
chronology’, northern Buddhist Sanskrit sources adopt a ‘short
chronology’, placing Asoka’s accession just 100 years after the
death of the Buddha, while recent research suggests that ASoka’s
accession may be plausibly placed anywhere between 280 and
267 BcE.!° But such figures as 218 and 100 should properly be seen
as ideal round numbers."' Moreover, as was first pointed out by
Rhys Davids and more recently by Richard Gombrich, a time
lapse of rather less than 218 years from the Buddha’s death to
ASoka’s accession is suggested by the figures associated with the
lineage of teachers found in a Pali source, namely an ancient Sri
Lankan chronicle, the Dipavamsa.'? While there is no scholarly
consensus on the precise dates of the Buddha, a detailed exam-
ination of all the available data and arguments by scholars in recent
years has resulted in a general tendency to bring the date of the
Buddha considerably forward and place his death much nearer
400 BCE than 500 BCE.

The earliest Buddhist sources state that the future Buddha was
born Siddhartha Gautama (Pali Siddhattha Gotama), the son of
a local chieftain—a rajan—in Kapilavastu (Pali Kapilavatthu) on
what is now the Indian—Nepalese border. He was thus a mem-
ber of a relatively privileged and wealthy family, and enjoyed
a comfortable upbringing. While the later Buddhist tradition,
in recounting the story of his youth, certainly likes to dwell on
the wealth of Siddhartha’s family and the extravagance of his
princely upbringing, there is something of a cultural misunder-
standing involved in the notion that the Buddhist tradition pre-
sents the Buddha as born a royal prince, the son of a great king.

The Buddha 15

In representing the Buddha as a rajan or ksatriya the tradition
is effectively recording little more than that he was, in European
cultural terms, a member of a locally important aristocratic fam-
ily. At some point he became disillusioned with his comfortable
and privileged life; he became troubled by a sense of the suf-
fering that, in the form of sickness, old age, and death, sooner
or later awaited him and everyone else. In the face of this, the
pleasures he enjoyed seemed empty and of little value. So he left
home and adopted the life of a wandering ascetic, a §ramana, to
embark on a religious and spiritual quest. He took instruction
from various teachers; he practised extreme austerities as was
the custom of some ascetics. Still he was not satisfied. Finally,
seated in meditation beneath an asvattha tree on the banks of
the Nairafijana in what is now the north Indian state of Bihar,
he had an experience which affected him profoundly, convin-
cing him that he had come to the end of his quest. While the
historian can make no judgement on the nature of this experi-
ence, the Buddhist tradition (apparently bearing witness to the
Buddha’s own understanding of his experience) calls it bodhi or
‘awakening’ and characterizes it as involving the deepest under-
standing of the nature of suffering, its cause, its cessation, and
the way leading to its cessation. The Buddha devoted the rest of
his life to teaching this ‘way to the cessation of suffering’ to groups
of wanderers and ordinary householders. In the course of his
wanderings across the plains that flank the banks of the Ganges
he gathered a considerable following and by the time of his
death at about the age of 80 he had established a well-organized
mendicant community which attracted considerable support
from the wider population. His followers cremated his body and
divided up the relics which were enshrined in a number of stiipas
which became revered shrines.

That the subsequent Buddhist tradition is founded upon
and inspired by the teaching activity of a charismatic individual
who lived some centuries before the beginning of the Christian
era can hardly be doubted. In the words of the great Belgian
scholar Etienne Lamotte, ‘Buddhism cannot be explained unless
we accept that it has its origin in the strong personality of its

16 The Buddha

founder.”'3 Given this premiss, none of the bare details of the
Buddha’s life is particularly problematic for the historian—
something we should bear in mind in the face of certain modern
scholarly discussions of the life of the Buddha, such as André
Bareau’s, which, in dwelling on the absence of corroborative
evidence for many of the details of the traditional life of the
Buddha, introduces a note of undue scepticism with regard to
the whole account.

Of course, as the Buddhist tradition tells it, the story of the
life of the Buddha is not history nor meant to be. The whole story
takes on a mythic and legendary character. A wealth of detail is
brought in capable of being read metaphorically, allegorically,
typologically, and symbolically. Much of this detail is to modern
sensibilities of a decidedly ‘miraculous’ and ‘supernatural’ kind.
The story of the Buddha’s life becomes not an account of the
particular and individual circumstances of a man who, some
2,500 years ago, left home to become a wandering ascetic, but
something universal, an archetype; it is the story of all those who
have become buddhas in the past and all who will become bud-
dhas in the future, and, in a sense, of all who follow the Buddhist
path. It is the story of the Buddhist path, a story that shows the
way to a profound religious truth. Yet for all that, many of the
details of his early life given in the oldest sources remain evocat-
ive of some memory of events from a distant time. If we persist
in distinguishing and holding apart myth and history, we are in
danger of missing the story’s own sense of truth. Furthermore,
the historian must recognize that he has virtually no strictly his-
torical criteria for distinguishing between history and myth in the
accounts of the life of the Buddha. And at that point he should
perhaps remain silent and let the story speak for itself.'*

The legend of the Buddha

Sources

The centrepiece of the legend of the Buddha is the story of the
Buddha’s life from his conception to the events of his awaken-
ing and his first teaching. This narrative must be accounted one

The Buddha 17

of the great stories of the world. Part of the common heritage
of Buddhism, it is known throughout Asia wherever Buddhism
has taken root. The core of this story and not a few of its details
are already found in the Sitra and Vinaya collections of early
Buddhist texts (see next chapter).'5 In literary works and in
sculptural reliefs that date from two or three centuries later, we
find these details embellished and woven together to form a more
sustained narrative. The classical literary tellings of the story
are found in Sanskrit texts such as the Mahavastu (‘Great Story’,
first century cE), the Lalitavistara (‘Graceful Description’, first
century cE), in ASvaghosa’s poem the Buddhacarita (‘Acts of
the Buddha’, second century ce), and in the Pali Niddnakatha
(‘Introductory Tale’, second or third century cE), which forms
an introduction to the commentary on the Jataka, a collection
of stories of the Buddha’s previous births.'* New narratives of
the life of the Buddha have continued to be produced down to
modern times.’

Tibetan tradition structures the story of the Buddha’s life
around twelve acts performed by all buddhas, while Theravadin
sources draw up a rather longer list of thirty features that are the
tule (dhammata) for the lives of all buddhas.'® The substance of
these two lists is already found in the oldest tellings of the story.
What follows is in effect the story of these twelve acts and (most
of) the thirty features, told with a bias to how they are recounted
in the early discourses of the Buddha and Pali sources, together
with some comments aimed at providing a historical perspective
on the development of the story.

The legend

The Buddhist and general Indian world-view is that all sentient
beings are subject to rebirth: all beings are born, live, die, and
are reborn again and again in a variety of different circum-
stances. This process knows no definite beginning and, ordinar-
ily, no definite end. The being who becomes a buddha, like any
other being, has known countless previous lives—as a human being,
an animal, and a god. An old tradition tells us that the life before
the one in which the state of buddhahood is reached is always

18 The Buddha

spent as a ‘god’ (deva) in the heaven of the Contented (Tusita/
Tusita). Here the bodhisattva (Pali bodhisatta)—the being intent
on awakening—dwells awaiting the appropriate time to take
a human birth and become a buddha. Dwelling in the Tusita heaven
is the first of the twelve acts, but how does the bodhisattva come
to be dwelling here? The answer, in short, is that it is as a result
of having practised ‘the perfections’ (pdramita/parami) over
many, many lifetimes.

Long ago, in fact incalculable numbers of aeons ago, there lived
an ascetic called Sumedha (or Megha by some) who encountered
a former buddha, the Buddha Dipamkara. This meeting affected
Sumedha in such a way that he too aspired to becoming a bud-
dha. What impressed Sumedha was Dipamkara’s very presence
and a sense of his infinite wisdom and compassion, such that he
resolved that he would do whatever was necessary to cultivate
and perfect these qualities in himself. Sumedha thus set out on
the path of the cultivation of the ten ‘perfections’: generosity,
morality, desirelessness, vigour, wisdom, patience, truthfulness,
resolve, loving kindness, and equanimity. In undertaking the
cultivation of these perfections Sumedha became a bodhisattva,
a being intent on and destined for buddhahood, and it is the life
in which he becomes the Buddha Gautama some time in the fifth
century BCE that represents the fruition of that distant aspira-
tion. Many jatakas—‘[tales] of the [previous] births [of the Bod-
hisattva]’—recount how the Bodhisattva gradually developed
the ‘perfections’. Such stories, like the story of the Buddha’s life,
are deeply embedded in Buddhist culture and serve to emphas-
ize how, for the Buddhist, the being who dwells in Tusita as one
intent on buddhahood is a being of the profoundest spiritual
qualities.

The appearance of such a being in the world may not be unique,
but is nevertheless a rare and special circumstance, for a buddha
only appears in the world when the teachings of a previous
buddha have been lost and when beings will be receptive to his
message. So it is said that surveying the world from Tusita the
Bodhisattva saw that the time had come for him to take a human
birth and at last become a buddha; he saw that the ‘Middle Coun-

The Buddha 19

try’ of the great continent of Jambudvipa (India) was the place
in which to take birth, for its inhabitants would be receptive to
his message. The Bodhisattva was conceived on the full moon
night of Asadha (July); that night his mother, Mahamaya, dreamt
that a white elephant carrying a white lotus in its trunk came and
entered her womb. The second and third acts, descent from
Tusita and entering his mother’s womb, had been accomplished.

Maya carried the Bodhisattva in her womb for precisely ten
lunar months. Then on the full moon of Vaisaékha (May), pass-
ing by the Lumbini grove on her way to her home town, she was
captivated by the beauty of the flowering Sala trees and stepped
down from her palanquin to walk amongst the trees in the grove.
As she reached for a branch of a Sala tree, which bent itself down
to meet her hand, the pangs of birth came upon her. Thus, ‘while
other women give birth sitting or lying down’, the Bodhisattva’s
mother was delivered of her child while standing and holding on
to the branch of a Sala tree. As soon as the Bodhisattva was born
he took seven steps to the north and proclaimed, ‘I am chief in
the world, I am best in the world, I am first in the world. This is
my last birth. There will be no further rebirth.’

Such is the legend of the Bodhisattva’s birth, the fourth act.
By the middle of the third century BcE a site reckoned to be the
place of his birth had become a centre of pilgrimage, and the great
Mauryan emperor ASoka—or, as he preferred to call himself,
Piyadassi Beloved of the Gods—whose empire extended across
virtually the entire Indian subcontinent, had inscribed on a
pillar at Lumbini:

When King Piyadassi, Beloved of the Gods, had been anointed twenty
years, he himself came and worshipped [here], because this is where the
Buddha, sage of the Sakyas, was born.”

The Bodhisattva was thus born among the Sakya people into
a ksatriya family whose name was Gautama. Seven days after
his birth his mother died and was reborn in the Tusita heaven.
The child was named Siddhartha—‘he whose purpose is accom-
plished’. Despite the strange and marvellous circumstances of his
birth, as he grew up the child appears to have forgotten he was

20 The Buddha

the Bodhisattva: he had no memory of his dwelling in Tusita or
any of his other previous births. However, certain predictions
of his future destiny were made to his father, Suddhodana.
Soon after his birth the infant Bodhisattva was examined by
brahmin specialists in ‘the thirty-two marks of the great man’
(mahapurusa-laksana/mahapurisa-lakkhana).”° This notion may
be of some antiquity in Indian tradition. These marks take the
form of signs on the body that indicate that the possessor is a
Great Man. Such marks may not be visible to the ordinary eye,
but it is said that certain brahmins kept the knowledge that was
capable of interpreting these marks. According to Buddhist tra-
dition two destinies are open to one who possesses these marks
in full: either he will become a great ‘wheel-turning’ (cakra-
vartin/cakka-vattin) king ruling the four quarters of the earth in
perfect justice, or he will become a buddha. On hearing that the
brahmins had pronounced his son was one who possessed the
thirty-two marks, Suddhodana determined that his son should
become a wheel-turning king. To this end he arranged matters
that Siddhartha should have no occasion to become unhappy and
disillusioned with his life at home: he would be sheltered from
all things unpleasant and ugly such as old age, sickness, and death;
whatever he wanted to make him happy, that he should have. In
this way Suddhodana hoped that he might prevent Siddhartha
from renouncing his home-life for the life of a wandering ascetic
and thus assure that he became not a buddha but a wheel-turning
king. We are told that Siddhartha married a young and beauti-
ful wife, YaSodhara, and had a son, Rahula, by her.

All this relates to the fifth of the twelve acts, the Bodhisattva’s
enjoyment of proficiency in worldly skills and sensuality. The old-
est sources say virtually nothing of the Bodhisattva’s life before
the time he left home. They indicate that he did indeed have a
wife and son, but apart from that all we have is a stock descrip-
tion of a life of luxury enjoyed by the very wealthy and privil-
eged placed into the mouth of the Buddha himself:

I was delicate, most delicate, supremely delicate. Lotus pools were
made for me at my father’s house solely for my use; in one blue lotuses

The Buddha 21

flowered, in another white, and in another red. I used no sandal wood
that was not from Benares. My turban, tunic, lower garments and cloak
were all of Benares cloth. A white sunshade was held over me day and
night so that I would not be troubled by cold or heat, dust or grit or
dew ... Yet even while I possessed such fortune and luxury, I thought,
‘When an unthinking, ordinary person who is himself subject to ageing,
sickness, and death, who is not beyond ageing, sickness, and death, sees
another who is old, sick or dead, he is shocked, disturbed, and disgusted,
forgetting his own condition. I too am subject to ageing, sickness, and
death, not beyond ageing, sickness, and death, and that I should see an-
other who is old, sick or dead and be shocked, disturbed, and disgusted
—this is not fitting.’ As I reflected thus, the conceit of youth, health,
and life entirely left me.”!

This brings us straight to the sixth act, disenchantment with his
life of pleasure. In the developed account this experience of
disenchantment with the world is related in terms of the story
of the Bodhisattva’s rides with his charioteer. As he leaves the
confines of his luxurious apartments, he encounters for the first
time in his life a decrepit old man, a severely ill man, and a corpse
being carried to the funeral pyre by mourners. The experience
is traumatic, and when he then sees a wandering ascetic with serene
and composed features Gautama resolves that he will leave his
home and take up the life of a wandering ascetic himself. The
Bodhisattva’s ‘great going forth’ (mahdapravrajya/mahapabbajja),
the seventh act, took place on the night of the Asadha full moon.
Accompanied by his charioteer, Channa, he went forth on his
horse, Kanthaka. According to traditional reckoning he was then
29 and this was the beginning of a six-year quest for awakening.
During these six years he first spent time with and practised
the systems of meditation taught by Arada Kalama (Pali Alara
Kalama) and then Udraka Ramaputra (Pali Uddaka Ramaputta).
Although he mastered their respective systems, he felt that
here he had not found any real answer to the problem of human
suffering. So next, in the company of five other wandering
ascetics, he turned to the practice of severe austerities. The old
texts preserve a hauntingly vivid description of the results of this
practice, the eighth act:

22 The Buddha

My body reached a state of extreme emaciation. Because of eating so
little my limbs became like the jointed stems of creepers or bamboo;
my backside became like a buffalo’s hoof; my backbone, bent or straight,
was like corded beads; my jutting and broken ribs were like the jutting
and broken rafters of an old house; the gleam of my eyes sunk deep in
their sockets was like the gleam of water seen deep down at the bottom
of a deep well.”

But by his gruelling penance he again felt he had not found what
he was searching for. Then he recalled an experience from his
youth. One day seated quietly beneath the shade of a rose-apple
tree his mind had settled into a state of deep calm and peace.
Buddhist tradition calls this state the first ‘meditation’ or dhyana
(Pali jhdna). According to the later Buddhist understanding,
this state is the gateway to a state of perfect mental calm and
equilibrium known as the fourth dhydna. As he reflected, it
came to the Bodhisattva that it was by letting the mind settle in
this state of peace that he might come to find what he was look-
ing for. This required that he nourish his body and regain his
strength. His five companions thought he had turned away from
the quest and left him to his own devices. In the full legend this
is the occasion of the young woman Sujata’s (or, according to
some, Nandabala’s) offering of milk-rice to the Bodhisattva. Now
nourished, he seated himself beneath an asvattha or pipal tree
(ficus religiosa), henceforth to be known as ‘the tree of awaken-
ing’ or Bodhi-tree. It was once more the night of the Vaisakha
full moon and he made a final resolve: ‘Let only skin, sinew and
bone remain, let the flesh and blood dry in my body, but I will
not give up this seat without attaining complete awakening.”* The
gods from many different world-systems gathered around the tree
sensing that something momentous was about to happen.
Again the oldest accounts describe the gaining of awakening
in generally sober psychological terms, most often by reference
to the successive practice of the four dhyanas and the gaining of
three ‘knowledges’, culminating in the knowledge of suffering,
its cause, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation—what
come to be known as ‘the four noble truths’; the awakening is
also described in terms of gaining insight into the causal chain

The Buddha 23

of ‘dependent arising’. These are classic elements of Buddhist
thought and we shall return to them later. Perhaps because they
do not exactly make for a good story, the later legend of the
Buddha recounts the awakening in terms of the story of the Bod-
hisattva’s encounter with Mara. This is a story rather more vivid
and immediately accessible than the abstract technical concepts
of Buddhist meditation theory.

Mara is a being who in certain respects is like the Satan of
Judaism, Islam, and Christianity. His name means ‘bringer of
death’ and his most common epithet is ‘the Bad One’ (papiyams/
papimant). Mara is not so much a personification of evil as of
the terrible hold which the world—in particular the world of the
senses—can have on the mind. Mara is the power of all kinds of
experience to seduce and ensnare the unwary mind; seduced by
Mara one remains lost in the enchantment of the world and fails
to find the path that leads through to the cessation of suffering.
So as the Bodhisattva sat beneath the tree firm in his resolve,
Mara, mounted on his great elephant, approached. He came
accompanied by his armies: desire, aversion, hunger and thirst,
craving, tiredness and sleepiness, fear, and doubt. His one pur-
pose was to break the Bodhisattva’s resolve and shift him from
his seat beneath the pipal tree. The gods who had gathered
around the tree in anticipation of the Bodhisattva’s awakening
fled at the sight of Mara’s approaching armies, and the Bod-
hisattva was left to face Mara and his armies alone.

Some relate how at this point the beautiful daughters of Mara
came before the Bodhisattva and tested his commitment to his
purpose by offering themselves to him.”* But the Bodhisattva
was unmoved. Mara then sent various storms against him. When
this too failed, Mara approached to claim the Bodhisattva’s seat
directly. He asked him by what right he sat there beneath the
tree. The Bodhisattva replied that it was by right of having
practised the perfections over countless aeons. Mara replied that
he had done likewise and, what was more, he had witnesses to
prove it: all his armies would vouch for him, but who would vouch
for the Bodhisattva? The Bodhisattva then lifted his right hand
and touched the ground calling on the very earth as his witness.

24 The Buddha

This is the ‘earth-touching gesture’ (bhimi-sparsa-mudra) de-
picted in so many statues of the Buddha through the ages. It sig-
nals the defeat of Mara and the Buddha’s awakening. As the
Buddha touched the earth Mara tumbled from his elephant and
his armies fled in disarray. With the ninth and tenth acts, the defeat
of Mara andthe attainment of complete awakening, Siddhartha
had accomplished his goal.

The legend of the Buddha is dense and rich at this point and
we must pass over many of its details. But according to tradition
the Buddha spent as many as seven weeks seated beneath and
in the vicinity of the Bodhi-tree enjoying the bliss of eman-
cipation. Once a great storm arose as the Buddha was seated
in meditation and a Naga, a great serpent, came and spread its
hood over the Buddha to protect him. Again this scene is often
depicted, especially in images of Cambodian provenance.

The Buddha had achieved his purpose; he had come to an under-
standing of suffering, and had realized the cessation of suffering.
In Buddhist terms, seated beneath the tree he had a direct
experience of ‘the unconditioned’, ‘the transcendent’, ‘the death-
less’, nirvana (Pali nibbana); he had come to know directly the
deep and underlying way of things that is referred to in India as
Dharma (Pali dhamma). It is said that at that point his mind
inclined not to teach:

This Dharma that I have found is profound, hard to see, hard to under-
stand; it is peaceful, sublime, beyond the sphere of mere reasoning,
subtle, to be experienced by the wise. But this generation takes delight
in attachment, is delighted by attachment, rejoices in attachment and
as such it is hard for them to see this truth, namely . . . nirvana.”

Even the oldest tradition seems to know the story of how the
great god, the Brahma called Sahampati, or ‘mighty lord’, came
then and stood before the Buddha and requested him to teach.
The implications of this story are various. Sometimes it is sug-
gested that it has been created as a device to show that even the
gods already recognized at that time in India acknowledge the
Buddha’s superiority. But there are perhaps other meanings. There
are reasons for thinking that the realm of Brahma is associated

The Buddha 25

with compassion in early Buddhist thought.”’ There is also a strong
Buddhist tradition that the teaching should only be given to those
who ask and thereby show their willingness to hear receptively.
Thus even today, in certain traditions of Buddhism, when a
layman makes a formal request to a Buddhist monk to teach
Dharma he consciously repeats Brahma’s original request by using
the very words of the ancient formula.

Then the Brahma Sahampati, lord of the world, with joined palms
requested a boon: There are beings here with but little dust in their eyes.
Pray teach Dharma out of compassion for them.”

In a deer park outside Benares the Buddha approached the five
who had been his companions when he practised austerities and
gave them instruction in the path to the cessation of suffering
that he had discovered. In this way he performed a buddha’s elev-
enth act: ‘setting in motion’ or ‘turning the wheel of Dharma’
(dharma-cakra-pravartana/dhamma-cakka-ppavattana), and soon,
we are told, there were six arhats in the world—six in the world
who had cultivated the path to the cessation of suffering and
realized the unconditioned.

For the Buddha this was the beginning of a life of teaching
that lasted some forty-five years. Many stories and legends are
recounted of the Buddha’s teaching career. Indeed, fourteen of
the thirty features given in the Pali sources as the rule for all bud-
dhas relate to it. To a large extent these incidents are preserved
by the earlier tradition in no systematic order, and it is left to
later tradition to organize them into a sequential narrative.” Most
of these legends must be passed over here but it is worth just
mentioning some since they form part of the common heritage
of Buddhism and are again and again alluded to by later tradi-
tion in literary texts and in paintings and stone relief. There is
the story of how the Buddha gained his two greatest disciples,
the monks Sariputra and Maudgalyayana; of how the monk
Ananda came to be his attendant; of how the Buddha performed
the extraordinary ‘miracle of the pairs’, causing fire and water
to issue from every pore of his body, and then ascended to
the heaven of the ‘Thirty-Three Gods’ to give his profoundest

26 The Buddha

teachings to his reborn mother. There is the story of the quar-
relling monks at Kausambi and of how the Buddha retired to the
Parileyyaka forest where he was attended by a lone elephant who
had grown weary of the herd, of how a monkey came to the Buddha
and offered him honey. There is the story of the dispute with his
cousin Devadatta, who attempted to kill him by releasing a
rogue elephant which the Buddha subdued by the strength of
his ‘loving kindness’ (maitri/metta).

As we shall see, it is one of the great emphases of Buddhist
teaching that the things of the world are impermanent and unre-
liable. To the extent that the Buddha is of the world then he is
no exception. There is a majestic and poignant account of the
Buddha’s last days preserved in the ancient canon under the title
of ‘the great discourse of the final passing’ (Mahaparinibbana
Sutta). According to tradition it was some time in his eighty-first
year that the Buddha fell ill:

1 am now grown old, Ananda, and full of years; my journey is done and
I have reached my sum of days; I am turning eighty years of age. And
just as a worn out cart is kept going with the help of repairs, so it seems
is the Tathagata’s body kept going with repairs.”

As the Buddha lay dying between two blossoming Sala trees, it
is related how the monk Ananda, who unlike many of his other
disciples had not achieved the state of arhatship or perfection,
lent against a door and wept. Then the Buddha asked for him:

Enough, Ananda, do not sorrow, do not lament. Have I not formerly
explained that it is the nature of things that we must be divided, sep-
arated, and parted from all that is beloved and dear? How could it be,
Ananda, that what has been born and come into being, that what is com-
pounded and subject to decay, should not decay? It is not possible.*!

The Buddha’s death constituted his ‘full going out’ (parinirvana/
parinibbana), the twelfth and final act of all buddhas. Before his
death the Buddha had given instructions that his remains should
be treated like those of a wheel-turning monarch and enshrined
in a stiipa where four roads meet. After the Buddha’s body had
been cremated, various messengers arrived from districts in

The Buddha 27

northern India each demanding a share of his relics. The relics
were thus divided into eight parts and eight different stipas
were built over them.

This is where we began this chapter. It is possible that the stipa
excavated by Peppé represents an enlargement of an older stiipa
—one that the Sakyas erected over their share of the relics at
Kapilavastu. The reliquary unearthed by Peppé appears to date
from the second century BcE. More recent excavations at the site
have unearthed further reliquaries—without any inscriptions—
from deeper within the stipa. These may date from the fourth
or fifth century Bcg. In that case Peppé’s reliquary would seem
to have been deposited when the stiipa was undergoing recon-
struction some centuries after the death of the Buddha.

The nature of a buddha

The Buddha is presented to us as in certain respects simply a
man: the Sramana or ascetic Gautama, the sage of the Sakya
people. Yet at the same time he is presented as something much
more than this: he was a buddha, an awakened one, the embodi-
ment at a particular time and place of ‘perfection’, a Tathagata,
one who comes and goes in accordance with the profoundest way
of things. At this point we need to begin to consider more fully
what it is to be a buddha.

Ihave already referred to a generally accepted Indian view of
things that sees ordinary humanity, ordinary beings, as being born,
dying, and being reborn continually. This process is the round
of rebirth known as samsara or ‘wandering’, and it is this that
constitutes the universe. Beings wander through this vast end-
less universe attempting to find some permanent home, a place
where they can feel at ease and secure. In the realms of the gods
they find great joy, and in the worlds of hell great suffering, but
their sojurn in these places is always temporary. Nowhere in this
universe is permanently secure; sooner or later, whatever the realm
of rebirth, a being will die to be reborn somewhere else. So the
search for happiness and security within the round of rebirth never
ends. And yet, according to the teaching of the Buddha, this does

28 The Buddha

not mean that the search for happiness and security is futile and
without end, for a buddha is precisely one who finds and follows
the path to the end of suffering.

Now the question of what happens to a buddha when he dies
takes us to the heart of Buddhist philosophical thinking. Here
Buddhist thought suggests that we must be very careful indeed
about what we say, about how we use language, lest we become
fooled. The Buddha cannot be reborn in some new form of exist-
ence, for to exist is, by definition, to exist at some particular time
and in some particular place and so be part of the unstable,
shifting world of conditions. If we say that the Buddha exists,
then the round of rebirth continues for the Buddha and the quest
for an end to suffering has not been completed. On the other
hand, to say that the Buddha simply does not exist is to suggest
that the Buddhist quest for happiness amounts to nothing but the
destruction of the individual being—something which is specific-
ally denied in the texts.** Hence the strict doctrinal formulation
of Buddhist texts is this: one cannot say that the Buddha exists
after death, one cannot say that he does not exist, one cannot
say that he both exists and does not exist, and one cannot say
that he neither exists nor does not exist.** One cannot say more
here without beginning to explore certain other aspects of Bud-
dhist metaphysics and ontology, and this I shall leave for later
chapters. The important point is that a Buddha is understood
as a being who has in some way transcended and gone beyond
the round of rebirth. He is a Tathagata, one who, in accordance
with the profoundest way of things, has come ‘thus’ (tatha) and
gone ‘thus’.**

So what does this transcendence imply about the final nature
of a buddha? If one is thinking in categories dictated and shaped
by the theologies of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and also
modern Western thought, there is often a strong inclination to
suppose that such a question should be answered in terms of the
categories of human and divine: either the Buddha was basically
aman or he was some kind of god, perhaps even God.* But some-
thing of an imaginative leap is required here, for these are not
the categories of Indian or Buddhist thought. In the first place,

The Buddha 29

according to the Buddhist view of things, the nature of beings is
not eternally or absolutely fixed. Beings that were once humans
or animals may be reborn as gods; beings that were once gods
may be reborn as animals or in hellish realms. Certainly, for the
Buddhist tradition, the being who became buddha or awakened
had been born a man, but equally that being is regarded as
having spent many previous lives as a god. Yet in becoming a
buddha he goes beyond such categories of being as human and
divine.

A story is told of how once a brahmin saw on the Buddha’s
footprints one of the thirty-two marks, wheels complete with a
thousand spokes, with rims and hubs.* He thought that such foot-
prints could hardly be those of a human being and followed them.
On catching up with the Buddha, he asked him whether he was
a god or some kind of angel or demon. The Buddha replied that
he was none of these. The brahmin then asked if he was a human
being. The Buddha replied that he was not. The brahmin was
puzzled. So what was the Buddha?

Just as a blue, red, or white lotus, born in water and grown up in water,
having risen above the water stands unstained by water, even so do I,
born in the world and grown up in the world, having overcome the
world, dwell unstained by the world. Understand that I am a buddha.

A buddha is thus a being sui generis: a buddha is just a buddha.”
But, in principle, according to Buddhist thought, any being can
follow the path of developing the perfections over countless
lives, and eventually become a buddha. That is, all beings have
the potential to become buddhas.

Thus something has happened to‘Gautama the man that means
that the categories that normally apply to beings no longer pro-
perly apply. Ordinarily a human being’s behaviour will sometimes
be motivated by greed, hatred, and delusion and sometimes by
such things as selflessness, friendliness, compassion, and wis-
dom. The different deeds, words, and thoughts of a being are an
expression of these conflicting emotions and psychological forces.
But for a buddha all this has changed. He has rooted out any
sense of pride, attachment, or hostility. The thoughts, words, and

30 The Buddha

deeds of a buddha are motivated only by generosity, loving kind-
ness, and wisdom. A buddha can think, say, and do nothing that
is not based on these. This is the effect or ‘fruit’ of what hap-
pened as he sat in meditation beneath the tree of awakening.

The bodies of the Buddha

One early Buddhist text puts it that the Buddha is ‘one whose
body is Dharma, whose body is Brahma; who has become
Dharma, who has become Brahma’.** Now dharma and brahma
are two technical terms pregnant with emotional and religious
meaning. Among other things Dharma is ‘the right way to
behave’, ‘the perfect way to act’; hence it is also the teaching of
the Buddha since by following the teaching of the Buddha one
follows the path that ends in Dharma or perfect action. We have
already come across the term Brahma denoting a divine being
(p. 24), but in Buddhist texts brahma is also used to denote or
describe the qualities of such divine beings; thus brahma con-
veys something of the sense of the English ‘divine’, something
of the sense of ‘holy’ and something of the sense of ‘perfec-
tion’. Like the English word ‘body’ the Sanskrit/Pali word kaya
means both a physical body and figuratively a collection or
aggregate of something—as in ‘a body of opinion’. To say that the
Buddha is dharma-kaya means that he is at once the embodiment
of Dharma and the collection or sum of all those qualities—
non-attachment, loving kindness, wisdom, etc.—that constitute
Dharma. Thus the nature of a buddha does not inhere primarily
in his visible human body—it is not that which makes him a
buddha—but in his perfected spiritual qualities.

Another passage of the ancient texts relates how the monk
Vakkali was lying seriously ill on his sick-bed; when the Buddha
arrives Vakkali explains to him that, although he has no sense
of failure in his conduct, he is troubled by the fact that because
of his illness he has not been able to come and visit the Buddha.
The Buddha responds: ‘Enough, Vakkali. What point is there in
your seeing this decaying body? He who sees Dharma sees me;
he who sees me sees Dharma.”

This kind of thinking gives rise in developed Buddhist
thought to various theories of ‘the bodies of the Buddha’. Such

The Buddha 31

theories are often presented as a distinguishing feature of later
Mahayana Buddhism. This is misleading. Certainly, there is a rather
sophisticated understanding of ‘the three bodies’ (trikaya) of the
Buddha worked out and expounded in the writings of the fourth-
century CE Indian Mahay4nist thinker Asanga (see Chapter 9).
But this theory stands at the end of a process of development,
and some conception of the bodies of the Buddha is common
to all Buddhist thought. What is common is the distinguishing
between the ‘physical body’ (riipa-kaya) and the ‘dharma-body’.

The physical body is the body that one would see if one
happened to meet the Buddha. Most people, most of the time,
it seems, would see a man who looked and dressed much like
any other Buddhist monk. However, recalling the stories of the
brahmins who examined the Buddha’s body after his birth and
the brahmin who followed his footprints, some people some of
the time see—or perhaps, more precisely, experience—a body
that is eighteen cubits in height and endowed with the thirty-
two marks of the great man as described in the Lakkhana Sutta,
‘the discourse on the marks of the great man’.” This apparently
extraordinary body appears in part to be connected with theories
of the ‘subtle body’ developed in meditation. All this then is the
physical body—the body as it appears to the senses. The Dharma-
body, as we have seen already, is the collection of perfect qual-
ities that, as it were, constitute the ‘personality’ or psychological
make-up of the Buddha.

A Buddha’s physical body and Dharma-body in a sense par-
allel and in a sense contrast with the physical and psychological
make-up of other more ordinary beings. According to a classic
Buddhist analysis that we shall have occasion to consider more
fully below, any individual being’s physical and psychological
make-up comprises five groups of conditions and functions: a
physical body normally endowed with five senses; feelings that
are pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral; ideas and concepts; various
desires and volitions; and self-consciousness. Any being might
be considered as consisting in the accumulation of just these
five ‘heaps’ or ‘aggregates’ (skandha/khandha) of physical and
psychological conditions. And in this respect a buddha is no
different. Yet a buddha has transformed these five into an

32 The Buddha

expression and embodiment of Dharma. Thus rather than, or as
well as, consisting in the accumulation of these five aggregates,
the psychological make-up of the Buddha might be considered
as consisting in the accumulation of another set of five ‘aggreg-
ates’, namely, the various qualities of perfect conduct (Sila/sila),
meditation (samadhi), wisdom (prajna/pannia), freedom (vimukti/
vimutti), and knowledge and understanding (vimukti-jndna-darsana/
vimutti-idna-dassana)."'

Sravaka-buddhas, pratyeka-buddhas, and samyak-sambuddhas

In this chapter we have seen how the Buddhist tradition regards
a particular historical individual—Siddhartha Gautama—as an
instance of a certain kind of rare and extraordinary being—a
buddha. Such a being having resolved to become a buddha by
making a vow in the presence of some previous buddha of a far
distant age, practises the perfections for countless lives and
finally, born as a man, attains buddhahood by finding ‘the path
to the cessation of suffering’; he then goes on to teach this path
to the cessation of suffering to others so that they may reach the
same realization as he has done, so that they too may become
‘awakened’ or buddha. Both Gautama and those who come
to realization by following his teachings—the arhats—may be
referred to as ‘buddhas’ since both, by the rooting out of greed,
hatred, and delusion, have come to understand suffering and
the path to its cessation. And yet, as the tradition acknowledges,
some difference between Gautama and the arhats must remain.
Gautama, the Buddha, has found the path by his individual striv-
ing without the immediate help of an already awakened being
and then gone on to show others the way.” His followers on the
other hand may have come to precisely the same understand-
ing and realization as Gautama but they have done so with the
assistance of his unequalled abilities as teacher.

We have then here two kinds of buddha: ‘the perfectly, fully
awakened one’ (samyak-/samma-sambuddha) like Gautama, and
the arhat or ‘one who has awakened as a disciple’ (Sravaka-/
savaka-buddha). Thus while on the one hand wishing to stress
that the ‘awakening’ of Gautama and his ‘awakened’ disciples is the

The Buddha 33

same, the Buddhist tradition has also been unable to resist the
tendency to dwell on the superiority of Gautama’s achievement.
Apart from becoming ‘awakened’ as a samyaksam-buddha or
arhat, Buddhist texts also envisage a third possibility: that one
might become awakened by one’s unaided effort without hearing
the teaching of a buddha and yet fail to teach others the way to
awakening. Such a one is known as a ‘solitary buddha’ (pratyeka-/
pacceka-buddha).

The sense that the achievements of these three kinds of ‘bud-
dha’ are at once the same but different—the Buddha’s achieve-
ment being somehow superior—is a tension that lies at the heart
of Buddhist thought and, as we shall see, explains in part certain
later developments of Buddhist thought known as the Mahayana.
How does the Buddha’s superiority to arhats and pratyeka-
buddhas manifest itself? In order to answer this question it is
useful to return to a question raised earlier concerning the Bud-
dha’s nature as man or god. In the context especially of early
Buddhism and Buddhism as practised today in Sri Lanka and
South-East Asia, once it has been established that theoretically
the Buddha is neither a god nor a ‘Saviour’, there has been a
tendency amongst observers to conclude that the Buddha ought
then to be seen by Buddhists as simply a man—as if this was the
only alternative. A further conclusion is then drawn that, since
Buddhism teaches that there is no ‘saviour’, the only way to ‘sal-
vation’ must be through one’s own unaided effort.

True, the Buddha did not create the world and he cannot
simply ‘save’ us—and the Buddhist would say that it is not so
much that the Buddha lacks the power as that the world is just
not like that: no being could do such a thing. Yet although no
saviour, the Buddha is still ‘the teacher of gods and men, the un-
surpassed trainer of unruly men’; in the Pali commentaries of
fifth-century Sri Lanka he is often referred to as simply the
Teacher (satthar). That is, we have here to do with a question of
alternative religious imagery and metaphor: not the ‘Father’ or
‘Saviour’ of Judaism or Christianity, but the Teacher. If one is
not familiar with the Indian cultural context it is easy to under-
estimate the potency of the image here. For a Buddhist no being

34 The Buddha

can match the Buddha’s abilities to teach and instruct in order
to push beings gently towards the final truth of things. A buddha
may not be able to save us—that is, he cannot simply turn us
into awakened beings—yet, if awakening is what we are intent
on, the presence of a buddha is still our best hope. Indeed some
contemporary Buddhists would suggest that it is no longer pos-
sible to reach awakening since conditions are now unpropitious;
rather it is better to aspire to be reborn at the time of the next
buddha or in a world where a buddha is now teaching so that
one can hear the teachings directly from a buddha. For the Bud-
dhist tradition, then, the Buddha is above all the great Teacher;
it is his rediscovery of the path to the cessation of suffering and
his teaching of that path that offers beings the possibility of fol-
lowing that path themselves.

As Teacher, then, the Buddha set in motion the wheel of
Dharma. As a result of setting in motion the wheel of Dharma
he established a community of accomplished disciples, the Sangha.
In the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha the Buddhist thus has ‘three
jewels’ (tri-ratna/ti-ratana) to which to go for refuge. Going to
the three jewels for refuge is realized by the formal recitation
of a threefold formula: ‘To the Buddha I go for refuge; to the
Dharma I go for refuge; to the Sangha I go for refuge.’ Going to
these three jewels for refuge is essentially what defines an indi-
vidual as a Buddhist. Having considered the Buddha, let us now
turn to consider his teaching and how that teaching is put into
practice by those who take refuge in the three jewels.

Dharma: texts, practice, and realization

The Buddha is author of no books or treatises. Moreover it is
extremely unlikely that any of his immediate disciples wrote any-
thing of his teachings down. And yet we are told that the Buddha
devoted some forty-five years of his life entirely to teaching
and that by the end of his life he was quite satisfied that he had
succeeded in passing on his teachings carefully and exactly, such
that they would long be of benefit and help to the world.' This
state of affairs is worth reflecting on, for it reveals something of
the nature of Buddhism.

Buddhism cannot be reduced to a collection of theoretical writ-
ings nor a philosophical system of thought—although both these
form an important part of its tradition. What lies at the heart of
Buddhism, according to its own understanding of the matter, is
dharma. Dharma is not an exclusively Buddhist concept, but
one which is common to Indian philosophical, religious, social,
and political thought in its entirety. According to Indian thought
Dharma is that which is the basis of things, the underlying nature
of things, the way things are; in short, it is the truth about things,
the truth about the world. More than this, Dharma is the way we
should act, for if we are to avoid bringing harm to both ourselves
and others we should strive to act in a way that is true to the way
things are, that accords with the underlying truth of things. Ulti-
mately the only true way to act is in conformity with Dharma.

The notion of Dharma in Indian thought thus has both a
descriptive and a prescriptive aspect: it is the way things are and
the way to act. The various schools of Indian religious and philo-
sophical thought and practice all offer slightly different visions

36 The Word of Buddha: Scriptures and Schools

(darsana) of Dharma—different visions of the way things are and
the way to act. Of course, when we examine the teachings of the
various schools, we find that there is often substantial common
ground and much borrowing from each other. Yet the Buddha’s
vision and understanding of Dharma must be reckoned to have
had a profound influence on Indian culture and, to an extent unpar-
alleled by other visions of Dharma, on cultures beyond India.

The Buddha regarded the Dharma he had found as ‘profound,
hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the
sphere of mere reasoning, subtle, to be experienced by the wise’.
Thus knowledge of Dharma is not something that is acquired
simply by being told the necessary information or by reading
the appropriate texts. Knowledge of Dharma is not a matter of
scholarly and intellectual study. This does mean that such study
may not have a part to play, yet it can never be the whole story.
In fact according to an ancient and authoritative view of the
matter knowledge of Dharma comes about as a result of the
interplay between three kinds of understanding (prajfia/pania):
that which arises from listening (Sruta/suta), that which arises from
reflection (cinta), and that which arises from spiritual practice
(bhavana).? The aim of Buddhism is to put into practice a par-
ticular way of living the ‘holy life’ or ‘spiritual life’ (brahma-cariya)
that involves training in ethical conduct (sila/sila) and meditative
and contemplative techniques (samadhi) and which culminates
in the direct realization of the very knowledge (prajid/panina)
the Buddha himself reached under the tree of awakening. There-
fore what the Buddha taught is often referred to in the early texts
as a system of ‘training’ (siksa/sikkha), and his disciples may be
referred to as being ‘in training’ (Saiksa/sekha) or ‘not in need
of further training’ (aSaiksa/asekha). Thus in certain important
respects the nature of the knowledge that the Buddha was trying
to convey to his pupils is more akin to a skill, like knowing how
to play a musical instrument, than a piece of information, such
as what time the Manchester train leaves tomorrow.

That knowledge of Dharma was conceived of in this way
explains in part why the written word was not originally the
medium for its communication. Practical training is difficult to

The Word of Buddha: Scriptures and Schools 37

impart and acquire simply on the basis of theoretical manuals;
one needs a teacher who can demonstrate the training and also
comment on and encourage one in one’s own attempts to put
the instructions into practice.* In fact a sense that knowledge is
not properly communicated by the written word colours the
traditional Indian attitude to learning in general: knowledge
must be passed from teacher to pupil directly. This does not mean
that at the time of the Buddha India had no literature. On the
contrary, in the form of the Rg Veda India has a literature that
predates the Buddha by perhaps as much as a thousand years.
But this literature is ‘oral’. It was composed orally, memorized,
and then passed from teacher to pupil directly by a process of
oral recitation for centuries, without ever being committed to writ-
ing. India’s is, of course, not the only culture to have an ancient
oral literature; the Iliad and the Odyssey, for example, grew out
of a tradition of oral composition, yet the oral origins of tradi-
tional Indian learning continued to inform its structure long
after texts had begun to be committed to writing.*

In presenting its teachings to the world, the Buddhist tradition
would thus point towards an unbroken lineage or succession of
teachers and pupils: just as the Buddha took care to instruct his
pupils, so they in turn took care to instruct theirs. The visible
and concrete manifestation of this succession is in the first place
the Sangha, the community of ordained monks (bhikkhu) and
nuns (bhikkhunt). Becoming a Buddhist monk or nun requires
a particular ceremony that is legitimate only if properly carried
out according to prescribed rules, which apparently go right
back to the time of the Buddha himself. In particular the pre-
scriptions for the ceremony require the presence of a minimum
of five fully ordained bhikkhus of at least ten years’ standing.
Thus when someone ordains as a Buddhist monk there is in effect
a direct link back to the presence of the Buddha himself. Of course,
the principle of the passing of the teachings directly from per-
son to person may also operate outside the Sangha, for members
of the Sangha do not only teach other members of the Sangha,
they teach lay people as well. Yet the Sangha remains the tan-
gible thread of the tradition.

38 The Word of Buddha: Scriptures and Schools

So the Buddha’s Dharma is mediated to us via the Sangha—
a community that ideally does not merely hand down some
vague recollection of what the Buddha taught but actually lives
the teaching. In the Pali commentaries written down in Sri
Lanka in the fifth century cE a distinction was made between
two kinds of monastic duty: that of books and that of practice
(see below, pp. 104—5).° The former is concerned with the study
of the theory as preserved in Buddhist writings. The latter is the
straightforward attempt to put the Buddha’s system of training
into practice, to live the spiritual life as prescribed by the Buddha
and his followers. Although this formal distinction is found in
the writings of a particular Buddhist school, the point being high-
lighted holds good for Buddhism as a whole. Throughout the his-
tory of Buddhism there has existed a certain tension between the
monk who is a great scholar and theoretician and the monk who
is a realized practitioner. Something of the same tension is in-
dicated in the sixth and seventh centuries in China with the
arising of the Ch’an (Japanese Zen) school of Buddhism, whose
well-known suspicion of theoretical formulations of the teach-
ing is summed up by the traditional stanza:

A special tradition outside the scriptures;
Not founded on words and letters;
~ Pointing directly to the heart of man;
Seeing into one’s own nature and attaining Buddhahood.°

The same kind of tension is in part reflected in a threefold
characterization of Dharma itself as textual tradition (pariyatti),
practice (patipatti), and realization (pativedha) once again found
in the Palicommentaries.’ The first refers to the sum of Buddhist
theory as contained in Buddhist scriptures, the second to the put-
ting into practice of those teachings, while the third to the direct
understanding acquired consequent upon the practice. The rest
of this chapter will primarily be concerned with Dharma as
textual tradition.

Dharma as textual tradition goes back to the teachings heard
directly from the Buddha. These teachings were, it seems, mem-
orized by the immediate followers of the Buddha. For several

The Word of Buddha: Scriptures and Schools 39

generations perhaps, the teachings of the Buddha were preserved
and handed down directly from master to pupil orally without
ever being committed to writing. It is tempting for us in the
modern world to be sceptical about the reliability of this method
of transmission, but it was the norm in ancient India; the use of
mnemonic techniques such as the numbered list and frequent
repetition of certain portions of the material within a given text
aided reliable transmission.* Indeed the evidence of the trans-
mission of the Vedic texts, for example, is that oral transmission
can be more reliable than a tradition of written texts involving
the copying of manuscripts.’

In the early phase of their transmission then the only access
to Buddhist ‘texts’ was by hearing them directly from someone
who had heard and learnt them from someone else, this oral trans-
mission of the texts being an activity that went on primarily within
the community of monks. Even after these texts began to be com-
mitted to writing their study was primarily a monastic concern.
Thus the ordinary lay Buddhist’s access to Buddhist teachings
was always through the Sangha: he or she learnt the Dharma by
sitting in the presence of a monk or nun and listening to their
exposition of the teachings. Thus, in so far as a monk or nun neces-
sarily follows a way of life defined by the prescriptions and rules
of Buddhist monasticism, the study of Buddhist theory always
took place in a context of practice. It is only in the twentieth
century—with the arrival of the modern printed book in tradi-
tional Buddhist societies, and the demand in the West for books
and information on Buddhism—that this state of affairs has begun
to change. That is, for over two millennia it was only by some
form of contact with the living tradition of practice that there
could be any knowledge of Buddhism.

The first recitation of scriptures: the four Nikayas/Agamas
and the Vinaya

According to a generally accepted ancient tradition, the first
attempt to agree the form of the Buddhist textual tradition, what
was remembered as the authoritative ‘word of the Buddha’,

40 The Word of Buddha: Scriptures and Schools

took place some three months after the Buddha’s death at the
town of Rajagrha (Pali Rajagaha) in northern India when 500
arhats took part in a ‘communal recitation’ (samgiti). This event
is commonly referred to in modern writings as ‘the first Buddhist
council’. Significantly the earliest Buddhist tradition attempts
to resolve any tension between theory and practice by insisting
that the first communal recitation of scriptures was carried out by
500 individuals who had each realized direct and perfect know-
ledge of Dharma. According to the accounts of this communal
recitation, what was remembered of the Buddha’s teachings fell
into two classes: the general discourses of the Buddha, the sitras
(Pali sutta), and his prescriptions for the lifestyle of the Buddhist
monk, the ‘discipline’ or vinaya. Some accounts suggest there
was a third category, matrkds (Pali matikd) or summary mne-
monic lists of significant points of the teaching. At any rate, later
canonical collections of Buddhist writings were subsequently
often referred to as ‘the three baskets’ (tri-pitaka/ti-pitaka): the
basket of discipline, the basket of discourses, and the basket of
‘further dharma’ (abhidharma/abhidhamma), whose development
is in part related to the use of the summary mnemonic lists or
matrkas.

Three principal ‘canons’ of Buddhist scriptures survive today
corresponding to the three main traditions of living Bud-
dhism: the Pali or Theravada canon of the southern tradition of
Sri Lanka and South-East Asia, the Chinese Tripitaka of the
eastern tradition of China, Korea, and Japan, and the Tibetan
Kanjur (bKa’ ’gyur) and Tenjur (bsTan ’gyur) of the northern tra-
dition of Tibet and Mongolia. All three of these collections are
extensive. Modern printed editions of the Pali canon run to some
fifty moderately sized volumes; the Taishd edition of the Chi-
nese Tripitaka comprises fifty-five volumes, each containing some
1,000 pages of Chinese characters; together the Tibetan Kanjur
and Tenjur comprise 300 traditional poti volumes. When the
contents of the three canons are compared it is apparent that,
while significant portions of the Pali canon are paralleled in the
Chinese collection, and there is considerable overlap between the
Chinese Tripitaka and the Kanjur and Tenjur, Buddhism as a

The Word of Buddha: Scriptures and Schools 41

whole does not possess a ‘canon’ of scriptures in the manner of
the Hebrew Bible of Judaism, the Old and New Testaments of
Christianity, or the Qu’ran of Islam. It is also apparent that the
Chinese and Tibetan canons do not represent en bloc transla-
tions of ancient Indian canonical collections of Buddhist texts,
but rather libraries of translations of individual Indian works made
over the centuries (see Chapter 10). In the case of the Chinese
canon this process of translating Indian texts began in the sec-
ond century cE and continued for over 800 years; the process
of arranging and cataloguing these texts continues down to the
present century. In the case of Tibetan Kanjur and Tenjur the
translation process was carried out between the seventh and
thirteenth centuries, while the precise contents and arrangement
of these two collections has never been fixed.

What of the Pali canon? The use of the term ‘Pali’ as the name
of the language of the Theravada canon of Buddhist scriptures
derives from the expression pdli-bhasd, ‘the language of the
[Buddhist] texts’. This language is an ancient Indian language
closely related to Sanskrit, the language of classical Indian cul-
ture par excellence. At the time of the Buddha, Sanskrit appears
to have been very much the language of brahmanical learning
and religious ritual. The Buddha therefore seems to have delib-
erately and consciously eschewed Sanskrit, preferring to teach
in the ordinary vernacular—the various Middle Indo-Aryan
dialects, known as Prakrit, which were spoken across the north
of India in the fifth century Bce." In the first century or so after
the death of the Buddha, as Buddhism began gradually to spread
across the Indian subcontinent, different groups of monks and
the evolving schools of Buddhism appear to have preserved
their own versions of the Buddha’s teaching orally in their local
dialect. However, as time passed there was a tendency for the
language of ‘the scriptures’ to become frozen and increasingly
removed from any actually spoken dialect. At the same time
Sanskrit was becoming less an exclusively brahmanical language
and more the accepted language of Indian culture—the language
in which to communicate learning and literature right across India.
Thus Buddhist scriptures were subject to varying degrees of

42 The Word of Buddha: Scriptures and Schools

‘sanskritization’ (‘translation’ is too strong here since the order
of difference between Middle Indian and Sanskrit is similar
to that between modern English and Chaucer’s or Mallory’s
English). Although basically Middle Indo-Aryan, the language
of the Pali canon is thus something of a hybrid, preserving lin-
guistic features of several dialects and showing some evidence
of sanskritization.

Theravada Buddhist tradition traces the Pali canon back to a
recension of Buddhist scriptures brought from northern India
to Sri Lanka in the third century BceE by Mahinda, a Buddhist
monk who was the son of the emperor Asoka. Mahinda and his
company brought no books, the texts being in their heads, but
the tradition is that the Pali texts were subsequently written down
for the first time in the first century BcE. The historical value of
this tradition is uncertain. Most scholars would be sceptical of
the suggestion that the Pali canon existed exactly as we have it
today already in the middle of third century BcE. We know, how-
ever, that what the commentators had before them in the fifth
century cE in Sri Lanka corresponded fairly exactly to what we
have now, and the original north Indian provenance and relative
antiquity of much of the Pali canon seems to be guaranteed on
linguistic grounds.!! Significant portions of-the material it con-
tains must go back to the third century BCE.

How many other versions or recensions of the canon of Bud-
dhist scriptures existed in partially or more fully sanskritized
Middle Indian dialects is unclear. The Pali canon is the only
one to survive apparently complete in an Indian language. Of
the other ancient Indian versions of the canon, we have only
isolated fragments and portions in the original Indian languages.
More substantial portions are, however, preserved in translation
especially in the Chinese Tripitaka. This, along with what Bud-
dhist literature as a whole reveals about its own history, allows
us to know something of the content of these other ancient
Indian canons and also to identify the generally more archaic
material—material that must be relatively close in time to the
ancient Rajagrha recitation. This material takes the form of the
four primary Nikayas or ‘collections’ of the Buddha’s discourses

The Word of Buddha: Scriptures and Schools B

—also known as the four Agamas or books of textual ‘tradition’
—along with the Vinaya or Buddhist monastic rule. These texts
constitute the essential common heritage of Buddhist thought,
and from this perspective the subsequent history of Buddhism
is a working out of their implications. This is not to imply that
Buddhism can somehow be reduced to what is contained in
these texts; one must understand that this ‘working out’ in prac-
tice constitutes much of what Buddhism has actually been and,
today, is. Nevertheless, in the quest for an understanding of Bud-
dhist thought these texts represent the most convenient starting
point.

Today we have two full versions of this Nikaya/Agama mat-
erial: a version in Pali forming part of the Pali canon and a ver-
sion in Chinese translation contained in the Chinese Tripitaka.
It is usual scholarly practice to refer to the Pali version by the
term ‘Nikaya’ and the Chinese by the term ‘Agama’. Like the
Pali canon as a whole, it is impossible to date the Pali Nikayas
in their present form with any precision. The Chinese Agamas
were translated into Chinese from Sanskrit or Middle Indo-
Aryan dialects around the end of the fourth century cg, but the
texts upon which they rest must like the Nikayas date from the
centuries before the beginning of the Christian era. Portions of
further versions of this material also come down to us in Tibetan
translation in the Tibetan Kanjur.

The four Nikayas/Agamas arrange the Buddha’s discourses
in the first place according to length. The collection of long dis-
courses (dirghagama/digha-nikaya) comprises some thirty siitras
arranged in three volumes; the collection of middle-length dis-
courses (madhyamagama/majjhima-nikaya) comprises some 150
siitras in the Pali version and 200 in the Chinese. Finally there
are two collections of shorter siitras. The first of these is ‘the
grouped collection’ (samyuktagama/samyutta-nikaya) which con-
sists of short sitras grouped principally according to subject
matter and dominated by the subjects of dependent arising, the
aggregates, the sense-spheres, and the path. The oral nature of
early Buddhist literature resulted in the proliferation of numbered
lists, in part as mnemonic devices, and the ‘numbered collection’

44 The Word of Buddha: Scriptures and Schools

(ekottarikagama/anguttara-nikaya) consists of short sitras built
around such a numbered list and grouped according to number
rather than topic.

In this book I generally quote from and refer to the Pali re-
cension of these texts. Using the Pali recension is in part a
matter of convenience and not a question of thereby suggesting
that the traditions it preserves are always the oldest and most
authentic available to us, even if it is likely that this is generally
the case. The Pali versions of these texts have been translated
into English in their entirety (unlike the Chinese and Tibetan
versions) and are readily available. That these texts have become
widely known over the past century through their Pali form has
sometimes led to an attitude which sees them as presenting the
peculiar perspective of Theravada Buddhism. But, as Etienne
Lamotte pointed out forty years ago, the doctrinal basis com-
mon to the Chinese Agamas and Pali Nikayas is remarkably uni-
form; such variations as exist affect only the mode of expression
or the arrangement of topics.” Far from representing sectarian
Buddhism, these texts above all constitute the common ancient
heritage of Buddhism.

The failure to appreciate this results in a distorted view of
ancient Buddhism, and its subsequent development and history
both within and outside India. From their frequent references
to and quotations from the Nikayas/Agamas, it is apparent that
all subsequent Indian Buddhist thinkers and writers of whatever
school or persuasion, including the Mahayana—and most certainly
those thinkers such as Nagarjuna, Asanga, and Vasubandhu,
who became the great Indian fathers of east Asian and Tibetan
Buddhism—were completely familiar with this material and treated
it as the authoritative word of the Buddha. When disagreements
arose among Buddhists they did not concern the authority of the
Nikaya/Agama material, but certain points of its interpretation
and the authority of other quite different material, namely the
Mahayana sitras, which we shall return to presently.

Alongside the four primary Nikaya/Agama collections of siitras
the ancient Indian canons like the Pali canon preserved a ‘minor’
(ksudraka/khuddaka) collection of miscellaneous texts that were

The Word of Buddha: Scriptures and Schools 45

also recognized as having the authority of the Buddha’s word.
This fifth collection included such works as the Dharmapada
(‘sayings on Dharma’) and the Jataka or stories concerning the
previous lives of the Buddha. The four Nikayas together with a
greater or lesser number of miscellaneous minor texts constituted
‘the basket of discourses’ (Sitra/Sutta Pitaka) for the earliest
Buddhist schools.?

The Pali canon, Chinese Tripitaka, and Tibetan Kanjur all
preserve versions of the ancient ‘basket of monastic discipline’
(Vinaya Pitaka): the Pali canon and Kanjur one each, the Chinese
Tripitaka four, plus an incomplete fifth. All six extant versions
of the Vinaya fall into two basic parts. The first is a detailed
analysis of the rules which constitute the pratimoksa (Pali
patimokkha) and which govern the life of the individual monk
or nun. The second comprises twenty ‘sections’ (skandhaka/
khandhaka) which set out the proper procedures for conducting
the various communal acts of the Sangha, such as ordination (see
Chapter 4).'4

Sutra and Abhidharma: the problem of textual authenticity

The Nikayas/Agamas are collections of sitras or ‘discourses’
regarded as delivered by the Buddha. The older term for a dis-
course of the Buddha preserved in Pali is sutta. It is not clear
what this term originally meant. When Buddhists started sans-
kritizing their texts they chose the word sitra. This is a term
which literally means ‘thread’ (compare English ‘suture’) but in
a literary context refers especially to authoritative brahmanical
texts consisting of a string of terse, aphoristic verses which a
pupil might memorize and a teacher might take as the basis for
exposition. Buddhist siitras, however, are not in this form. As
Richard Gombrich has pointed out, it is perhaps more likely that
Middle Indo-Aryan sutta corresponds to Sanskrit siikta, which
means ‘something that is well said’ and was early in the history
of Indian literature used to refer to the inspired hymns of the
Vedic seers that make up the collection of the Rg Veda. Early

46 The Word of Buddha: Scriptures and Schools

Buddhists can therefore be seen as claiming a status on a par
with the Vedas for the utterances of the Buddha.

Be that as it may, a Buddhist siitra always begins with the words:
‘Thus have I heard. At one time the Lord was staying at...”
The later tradition understands these as the words of Ananda,
the Buddha’s attendant, introducing each discourse of the Buddha
at the first communal recitation. The inclusion of this particular
formula at the beginning of a Buddhist text indicates that the text
claims the status of ‘the word of the Buddha’ (buddha-vacana).
It is clear that from a very early date there is a tacit understanding
that to claim this status for a text is not exactly to claim that it
represents only what has actually been uttered by the Buddha
in person. Even in the Nikaya/Agama collections accepted as
‘the word of the Buddha’ by all ancient schools, there are sitras
presented as delivered not by the Buddha but by monks and nuns
who were his chief pupils—some of them after his death.

As indicated above, the notion of a fixed canon of Buddhist
scriptures is somewhat problematic. And we must be careful not
to impose inappropriate notions of ‘canon’ and authenticity—
derived, say, from Christianity—on the Buddhist tradition. Even
in the accounts of the first Buddhist council we are told of a monk
who, on hearing of the recitation of the Buddha’s teaching by
the 500 arhats, declared that he preferred to remember the
teaching as he himself had heard it directly from the Buddha.”
For several centuries as Buddhism spread across the Indian
subcontinent it is clear that, while the Buddhist community
accepted and preserved a common core of textual material,
this material constituted a ‘canon’ in only a rather loose and
informal sense; that each and every collection of textual material
should correspond exactly was not regarded by the early com-
munity as the critical issue.

This state of affairs is reflected in the discussion of ‘the four
great authorities’ (mahdpadesa) to which a monk might appeal
for accepting a particular teaching as authentic Dharma: that he
has heard it from the Buddha himself, from a community of elder
monks, from a group of learned monks, or from one learned monk.
In each case the Buddha is recorded as having instructed monks

The Word of Buddha: Scriptures and Schools 47

to examine and consider the teaching in order to see if it con-
forms to what they already know the teaching to be.'* This is not
quite as subjective as it sounds. The discourses of the Buddha
as preserved in the Nikayas do not of themselves constitute a
systematic exposition of Buddhist thought with a beginning,
middle, and end. Each discourse is rather presented as a more
or less self-contained piece on a particular theme. And yet, the
discourses as a whole do contain quite explicit indications of how
these various themes relate to each other and fit together to form
an overall structure and pattern.’’ The final criterion for judging
a teaching lies in an appreciation and understanding of this
overall structure and pattern of the teaching. Thus at times the
question of who originally spoke the words appears irrelevant to
the tradition: ‘Whatever monk, nun, male or female layfollower,
god or... Brahma might teach and proclaim Dharma, it is all
considered as taught and proclaimed by the Teacher [i.e. the
Buddha].’”° Nevertheless the principle that certain texts repres-
ent the primary ‘word of the Buddha’, while others are the sec-
ondary work of commentators and scholars, remains significant
to the Buddhist tradition. And the question of just which texts
are to be counted as the word of the Buddha has, at particular
points in the history of Buddhism, been a critical one.

The term abhidharma (Pali abhidhamma) means approxim-
ately ‘higher’ or ‘further’ Dharma. In many ways the extant works
of ‘the basket of Abhidharma’, the third part of the ancient
canon of Buddhist scriptures, can be seen as continuing the pro-
cess of systematization already evident in the Nikayas. That
some form of commentary and interpretation formed part of
Buddhism almost from its inception is indicated by certain of
the siitras in the Nikayas. The Mahavedalla Sutta, for example,
recounts how a nun is approached and asked to comment on
certain technical terms of the Buddha’s teaching;! in the Vinaya
each rule of the monastic discipline is followed by ‘a word ana-
lysis’ which defines key terms of the rulings; and one of the later
books of the Pali canon must be the Niddesa (‘Exposition’),
which takes the form of a commentary on a section of another
work of the canon, the Suttanipata (‘Group of Discourses’). But

48 The Word of Buddha: Scriptures and Schools

it is the Abhidharma par excellence that represents the earliest
attempt to give a full and systematic statement of the Buddha’s
teaching on the basis of what is contained in his discourses.
The traditional understanding is thus that while the siitras rep-
resent the Buddha’s teaching applied in particular circumstances
at a particular time and place, the Abhidharma is the Buddha’s
teaching stated in bare and general terms without reference to
any particular circumstances.

Something of the Abhidharma method must go back to the
lifetime of the Buddha himself. Certainly much of its outlook
and many of its principles must be regarded as still forming part
of the common heritage of Buddhism, alongside the Nikaya/
Agama sitra collections and the monastic rule of the Vinaya.
Yet in addition to what is common, we begin to find in the
Abhidharma literature interpretations and understandings of the
Sitra material that are specific to particular schools of Buddhism.
We must be careful, however, to understand this situation in
the light of our knowledge of just what constituted a Buddhist
‘school’ in ancient India, and avoid the trap of thinking that
Buddhist ‘schools’ evolved and defined themselves in the same
way as, say, Christian ‘sects’ or ‘denominations’.

We have substantial knowledge of the Abhidharma liter-
ature and systems of only two ancient Buddhist schools: the
Sarvastivadins and the Theravadins. The only obvious similarity
between their respective Abhidharma Pitaka collections, how-
ever, is that they both contain just seven works (see Chapter 7).
Despite the great status and authority attributed to the Abhid-
harma and the claim that it is ‘the word of the Buddha’, both
these schools explicitly acknowledge the work of the Buddha’s
chief disciples in arranging and transmitting the Abhidharma.
From this point of view, the Abhidharma has for the tradition
the status of a stra or set of headings expanded by one of the
Buddha’s disciples and then subsequently endorsed by the Bud-
dha.” Even so, some ancient Buddhists, such as the Sautrantikas
or ‘those who follow the Sitra’, came to resist the notion that the
Abhidharma had the full status of ‘the word of the Buddha’. Yet
while such a group may have wished to deny the Abhidharma

The Word of Buddha: Scriptures and Schools 49

the status of the Buddha’s word, it is clear that they did not seek
to question the method and principles of Abhidharma in their
entirety; what they were concerned to question were particu-
lar interpretations and understandings current amongst certain
exponents of Abhidharma.

To sum up, a typical ancient Indian ‘canon’ of Buddhist texts
consisted of ‘three baskets’ (tripitaka): the Siitra Pitaka or ‘bas-
ket of discourses’ (comprising four main collections of the dis-
courses of the Buddha, often with a supplementary collection of
miscellaneous texts), the Vinaya Pitaka or ‘basket of monastic
discipline’, and the Abhidharma Pitaka or ‘basket of further
Dharma’. Only one such ancient Tripitaka survives complete
in an ancient Indian language, the Pali canon of the Theravadin
tradition of Sri Lanka and South-East Asia. How many other recen-
sions of this ancient Tripitaka existed is unclear, but the contents
and arrangement of others may be partially reconstructed on
the basis of the surviving fragments in Indian languages and
Chinese and Tibetan translations; in this respect we have the fullest
knowledge of the canon of the Sarvastivadins.

The origin of the ancient Buddhist schools and their
exegetical literatures

In turning to the complex problem of the origin of the ancient
Indian Buddhist schools, we must at the outset register that we
are speaking primarily of divisions and groupings within the
community of monks and nuns or Sangha. In most cases the basis
of such divisions would have been of little or no concern to the
ordinary lay Buddhist in ancient India. In other words, we are
not dealing with great schisms of the kind associated with the
Reformation in the history of Christianity, or with one Buddhist
group accusing another of ‘heresy’. In order to understand the
processes at work here it is necessary first to consider the notion
of formal division in the Sangha (sangha-bheda) from the legal
perspective of the Buddhist monastic code encapsulated in the
Vinaya.*

50 The Word of Buddha: Scriptures and Schools

Two communal ceremonies are fundamental to the constitu-
tion of the Sangha; the first is the ordination ceremony itself,
the second is the fortnightly rehearsal of the rule (pratimoksa/
patimokkha). As I have already mentioned, for an ordination to
be legitimate the participation of at least five monks of ten years’
standing is required. The pratimoksa ceremony involves the
gathering together of the members of the Sangha in a given local-
ity in order to recite the rule and confess any breaches; a valid
ceremony requires a quorum of at least four monks. Since both
valid ordination and pratimoksa ceremonies are thus essential
for any group of monks’ claim to be monks, it follows that, even
in the short term, only a schismatic group that includes at least
four monks in its party is viable; for a schismatic group to be viable
in the long term it must include five senior monks in its party.
Clearly in the first century or so after the Buddha’s death, as
the numbers in the Sangha increased and it expanded across first
northern India and then the whole subcontinent, the establish-
ment of groups of monks around particular teachers, perhaps asso-
ciated with particular views on certain issues of Abhidharma, was
both natural and inevitable. But as long as such groups followed
essentially the same Vinaya and recognized the validity of each
other’s ordination lineage, movement between the groups would
present no problem: monks from one group could legitimately
attend and participate in the ceremonies of another group; there
was no question of formal division in the Sangha.

One should note here that holding a particular opinion or view
on any matter—let alone on a moot point of Abhidharma philo-
sophy—cannot be grounds for expulsion from the Sangha. The
grounds for expulsion from the Sangha are sexual intercourse,
taking what is not given, intentionally killing a human being,
and falsely claiming spiritual attainments. The only opinion or
view that is even to be censured according to the Vinaya is the
view that sexual intercourse is not an ‘obstacle’. It is easy to see
the practical reason why: it threatens the very basis of a celibate
community. Since the Vinaya left monks and nuns largely free
to develop the Buddha’s teaching doctrinally as they saw fit,
there would be little incentive to provoke a schism on purely

The Word of Buddha: Scriptures and Schools 51

doctrinal grounds. What was of public concern was living by the
monastic rules, not doctrinal conformity. We are dealing here
with orthopraxy, not orthodoxy. The implications of this state of
affairs were not fully realized in the earlier scholarly studies of
the formation of the Buddhist schools, such as André Bareau’s
important work, Les Sectes bouddhiques du petit véhicule.

It is not surprising to find then that the earliest indication in
Buddhist writings of schismatic tendencies in the Sangha con-
cerns interpretation of the Vinaya and not questions of Buddhist
doctrine. As with the first ‘communal recitation’, the ancient
sources that have come down to us via various schools are in broad
agreement that one hundred years—the figure is likely to be
approximate—after the death of the Buddha a dispute arose con-
cerning ten points of Vinaya. A group of senior monks convened
at Vaisali (Pali Vesalt), decided against the ten points, and ini-
tiated a second communal recitation of the scriptures.

The traditions preserved in the ancient sources concerning the
Buddhist councils and the division of the Sangha into its various
schools are complex and inconsistent. Despite the scholarly
discussion that has been devoted to them, a satisfactory inter-
pretation of these sources explaining the contradictions and
presenting a coherent and consistent history of Buddhism in the
centuries after the death of the Buddha has yet to be worked
out. It seems clear that, at some point after the Vaisali meeting,
the primitive Sangha formally divided into two parties each of
which thenceforth had its own ordination traditions. The ancient
accounts are inconsistent as to what provoked the split. Some
suggest that it was the result of a dispute over five points, later
associated with a monk named Mahadeva, concerning the nature
of the arhat. That this was indeed the cause of the division was
accepted by Bareau. Other ancient sources attribute the division
to a disagreement over questions of Vinaya, and the more recent
scholarship suggests that this is the explanation to be preferred.
According to this view a reformist group in the Sangha proposed
tightening discipline on certain matters of Vinaya, while the
majority were happy to leave things as they stood. Since the two
parties failed to come to an agreement, the Sangha divided

52 The Word of Buddha: Scriptures and Schools

into two: the reformist sthaviras (Pali thera) or ‘elders’ and the
majority mahasamghikas or ‘those of the great community’.* The
dating of this important event in the history of Buddhism is also
extremely problematic since it hinges on the vexed question of
the date of the death of the Buddha himself. With the growing
scholarly consensus that dates the Buddha’s death at the end of
the fifth century BcE or even the beginning of the fourth, it seems
that we must place the event of the first division of the Sangha
some time around the beginning of the third century BcE before
the accession of the emperor Asoka (c.268 BCE); although it is
not impossible that we should follow certain of our sources
which suggest that the division occurred actually during the reign
of Asoka.

In the century or so following this fundamental division of
the Sangha into the Sthaviras and Mahasamghikas it is clear
that further schools emerged. Yet the processes by which these
schools came into being is not so clear; whether they occurred
as the result of formal disagreements over some Vinaya issue that
resulted in deadlock and was thus the occasion for formal divi-
sion of the Sangha (i.e. sargha-bheda), or whether they merely
represent de facto divisions of the Sangha that evolved haphaz-
ardly as the Sangha spread and grew, is not certain. The names
of the schools variously suggest characteristic teachings, geo-
graphical location, or the followings of particular teachers. At
least some of the schools mentioned by later Buddhist tradition
are likely to have been informal schools of thought in the manner
of ‘Cartesians’, ‘British Empiricists’, or ‘Kantians’ for the history
of modern philosophy.”

The primary sub-schools of the Sthaviras focus on certain
technical points of Abhidharma. The Vatsiputriyas (‘followers
of Vatsiputra’) and their sub-schools adopted a particular posi-
tion on the ontological status of ‘the person’ (pudgala/puggala)
and were thus referred to as ‘advocates of the doctrine [of the
existence] of the person’ (pudgala-vadin).

Another group developed a particular understanding of the
way things exist in past, present, and future time; they were known
as ‘advocates of the doctrine that all things [past, present, and

The Word of Buddha: Scriptures and Schools 53

future] exist’ (sarvasti-vadin). Yet another group were known
as ‘advocates of the doctrine of analysis’ (vibhajyavadin). In
some contexts this last group is represented as analysing exist-
ence as either in the past, present, or future, in opposition to the
Sarvastivadins; elsewhere the exact significance of the appella-
tion is not made clear. The Sri Lankan Theravada or ‘advocates
of the doctrine of the elders’ in fact traces its lineage through the
Vibhajjavadins (Sanskrit vibhajyavadin). According to their tra-
ditions the Vibhajjavadins were the favoured party in a dispute
that took place at Pataliputra during the reign of the emperor
Asoka. Bareau therefore concluded that this dispute concerned
the split between the Sarvastivadins and Vibhajjavadins on the
matter of the abstruse Abhidharma question of existence in the
three times. The ancient accounts of this dispute are, however,
confused and inconsistent.”’ Its basis, in so far as it is stated in
the sources, seems to have been not so much the finer points
of Abhidharma philosophy as a Vinaya matter: the fact that non-
Buddhists were masquerading as Buddhist monks without being
properly ordained or keeping to the rules of the Vinaya. The
outcome is stated as the expulsion of the false monks from the
Sangha and a third communal recitation (after those of Rajagrha
and Vaisali) of the canon of Buddhist scriptures. The latter
turned on—rather incongruously given the stated nature of the
dispute—the exposition by Moggaliputtatissa of the Kathavatthu
(‘Discussion Points’), a manual of moot Abhidharma points,
which was thereafter counted as one of the canonical works
of the Pali Abhidhamma Pitaka. As K. R. Norman suggests, it
would appear that two different events have been conflated.
The relevance of such abstruse matters as existence in the three
times of present, past, and future to the theory and practice of
Buddhism may not be immediately clear to the reader, and is
something I shall return to in Chapter 8. But the very technical
nature of these matters makes it, I think, extremely unlikely that
they were ever the real impetus behind formal division in the
Sangha. It is inconceivable that a Buddhist monk who did or did
not adopt the position of, say, sarvastivada should ever be charged
with a Buddhist equivalent of ‘heresy’ and that this should

54 The Word of Buddha: Scriptures and Schools

become an issue in determining whether he could participate in
the formal ceremonies of the Sangha. The failure to realize this
is something of a shortcoming in Bareau’s pioneering and schol-
arly study of the Buddhist councils.

Certain non-Theravadin sources are also suggestive of a dis-
pute at Pataliputra during the reign of Asoka, but they link the
dispute to the second communal recitation or, as we have seen,
the question of Mahadeva’s five points; only one of these sources
—a relatively late one—mentions a third communal recitation
in this connection.** Yet that some kind of dispute did occur at
Pataliputra during the reign of ASoka receives some corrobora-
tion in the form of his so-called schism edict.

Ancient Buddhist sources preserve various lists of schools
which invariably state the total number to be eighteen while in
fact listing rather more; the number eighteen seems to be ideal
and symbolic.” A rough assessment of the evidence in the light
of the witness of inscriptional evidence, extant Vinayas, and the
Chinese pilgrims, suggests that we should rather think in terms
of four major groupings—the Mahasamghikas, the Sthaviras,
the Vatsiputriya-Sammatiyas, and the Sarvastivadins—with the
Mahisasakas, Dharmaguptakas, and Kasyapiyas also represent-
ing significant sub-schools of the Sthaviras.

It is legitimate, I think, to see the exposition of the basic prin-
ciples and method of Abhidharma as the product of the first gen-
eration of the Buddha’s disciples. As such it obviously carried
great weight and authority, and for much of the tradition was
indeed ‘the word of the Buddha’. And yet, even while granting
it the status of the Buddha’s word, in acknowledging the con-
tribution of the early disciples in its transmission, the tradition
itself retains a sense that the Abhidharma is one step removed
from the Teacher himself. It is in this respect that I suggest that
the early Abhidharma can be seen as the original ‘commentary’
upon the Buddha’s teaching. But as Buddhism spread across the
Indian subcontinent, subsequent generations of the Buddha’s
disciples further refined the Abhidharma systems of thought and
contributed to the gradual evolution of the different schools.
Increasingly in this context the Buddhist tradition as a whole began

The Word of Buddha: Scriptures and Schools 55

to acknowledge freely that its new literary productions did not
have the status of ‘the word of the Buddha’ (that is, Sitra or
Agama), but were rather commentaries (atthakatha, bhasya,
vibhasa) on or textbooks (sastra) of the teaching of the Buddha.
In all this there is no convenient point after which we can say we
are dealing exclusively with self-conscious commentary. Most of
the commentaries and manuals come down to us in a form that
post-dates the beginning of the Christian era, yet they refer
to and record the views of ‘the ancient teachers’, and we can
be certain that some of their traditions are considerably older,
although it may not always be easy to determine precisely which.

The exegetical literature of most of the ancient schools is
lost. We only have significant knowledge of two traditions: the
Sarvastivadins and the Thervadins, the Sri Lankan representat-
ives of the Sthaviras. I would like to single out two manuals that
I shall be continually referring to throughout this book as pro-
viding convenient and at the same time authoritative summaries
of Buddhist theory and practice. Both these manuals were pro-
duced in the fifth century ce but their authority has continued
to be recognized down to the present day.

The first is the Visuddhimagga or ‘Path of Purification’, a sum-
mary statement of Theravada teaching, whose text in English trans-
lation runs to over 800 pages.” It is the work of Buddhaghosa,
a monk who, so the story goes, travelled from north India to
Anuradhapura, the ancient capital of Sri Lanka and an import-
ant centre of Buddhist learning, where he took up residence in
the Mahavihara (the Great Monastery). With access to earlier
commentaries preserved in the Mahavihara, he produced, as well
as the Visuddhimagga, definitive commentaries to the principal
works of the Pali canon. The Visuddhimagga is one of the classic
texts of the Theravada or ‘southern’ tradition of Buddhism.

The second manual is the Abhidharmakosa or ‘Treasury of
Abhidharma’, which takes the form of a summary statement of
the teachings and traditions of the Sarvastvadins in just less than
600 verses. Its author, Vasubandhu, a monk who lived in north
India, furnished these verses with his own commentary (bhdsya)
which, in addition to expanding on the verses, provides a critique

56 The Word of Buddha: Scriptures and Schools

of the Sarvastivada from the perspective of the Sautrantika
school. In English translation the verses along with their com-
mentary fill more than 1,300 pages.” The AbhidharmakoSa was
translated into Chinese in the sixth century and again in the sev-
enth; later it was also translated into Tibetan. It thereby came
and continues to be one of the great theoretical texts of both east
Asian Buddhism and northern Buddhism.

The Mahayana sitras

In this manner, in the centuries following the Buddha’s death,
the various ancient schools of Indian Buddhism began to evolve,
preserving their distinctive recensions of the Sitra and Vinaya
Pitakas, and developing their characteristic understandings
of Abhidharma. Against this background we find, beginning
around the beginning of the Christian era, a rather different kind
of Buddhist literature emerging. Hitherto unknown texts that begin
with the words ‘thus I have heard’—the traditional opening of
the discourses of the Buddha—begin to appear. In other words,
these new texts present themselves not as the commentary or
understanding of a particular school of Buddhism, but as actual
siitras. They thus claim the status of ‘the word of the Buddha’.
The texts in question are the early sitras of ‘the Great
Vehicle’ (mahdaydana). The origins of the Mahaydna are complex
(see Chapter 9), but this was not a sectarian literature dissemin-
ated by one of the existing schools nor did it lead to the devel-
opment of a formal division of the Sangha (samgha-bheda),
with an associated Mahayana recension of the Vinaya. Indeed,
the very idea of an exclusively Mahayana Vinaya seems only to
have emerged in eighth/ninth-century Japan with the Tendai monk
Saichd. At the time of the emergence of Mahayana literature
in ancient India, members of the Sangha who were sympathetic
to it followed their interest while remaining within the already
existing schools and ordination lineages of the Sangha, almost
invariably continuing to live alongside monks and nuns who did
not necessarily share their interest. The question of the status
and authority of the new literature was thus initially not decided

The Word of Buddha: Scriptures and Schools 57

along sectarian lines; monks from various of the existing schools
would have been more or less favourably inclined towards the
new sutras. In time, certain schools more formally and explicitly
refused to acknowledge the authority of the Mahayana siitras,
but such uncompromising attitudes were perhaps not relevant
until as late as the fifth century ce. The reason for this was that
for the most part the new sitras represented something of a minor-
ity and esoteric interest, rather than a mass popular movement;
and this appears to have remained so for at least several
centuries.” According to the figures reported by the Chinese
monk Hsiiantsang, by the seventh century monks following the
Mahayana constituted about half of the Indian Sangha. But it
is likely that this is an inflated figure.

The production of Mahayana sitras spans a period of some
six or seven centuries. Just as the earlier siitras of the Nikayas/
Agamas had already given rise to the Abhidharma and the dis-
tinctive interpretations of a number of schools, so the Mahayana
siitras are also associated with the production of treatises and
commentaries associated with the emergence of new philosoph-
ical schools of Buddhism. Three writers should be singled out in
this connection since I will be referring to them from time to time.
The first is Nagarjuna, a monk probably from the south of India
who lived in the second century ce and was the author of the
Madhyamaka-karika (‘Verses on the Middle’) as well as a num-
ber of other works. He is revered by the Buddhists of China
and Tibet as the founding father of one of the principal ‘Sastra’
systems of Mahayana philosophy, namely the Madhyamaka or
Stinyavada. The other two authors can be taken together. Indeed,
tradition has it that they were brothers. They are Asanga and
Vasubandhu, who lived in north India at the end of the fourth
or beginning of the fifth century ce. According to tradition, ques-
tioned by modern scholarship (see Chapter 7), this Vasubandhu
is one and the same Vasubandhu whom I mentioned above as
author of the Abhidharmako§Sa. Together these two are regarded
as the founding fathers of the other great ‘Sastra’ school of
the Mahayana, namely the Yogacara or Vijfianavada, which ex-
pounded the theory that apart from consciousness or mind (citta,

58 The Word of Buddha: Scriptures and Schools

vijfidna) and the ideas and information (vijfapti) it processes, there
is nothing.

Mahayana Buddhism as a more or less separate tradition of
Buddhism, with its clearly defined subdivisions and philosoph-
ical schools, is to some extent the outcome of the history of
Chinese and Tibetan Buddhism. As it evolved in China and
Tibet, Buddhism came to adopt an exclusively Mahayanist out-
look in a way that it never did in India. As Buddhism began to
fade from the Indian scene in the eleventh and twelfth cen-
turies, the Buddhists of China, Japan, and Korea to the east, and
Tibet and Mongolia to the north, were left as heirs to the Indian
MahAyanist vision. To the south the Buddhists of Sri Lanka and
South-East Asia became the only surviving representatives of the
perspective of the non-Mahayana. Yet we must remember that
much of what modern Buddhists in Sri Lanka, China, or Tibet
have inherited from the past was held in common by both the
Mahayana and non-Mahayana tradition. And it is with this
common heritage that I am mostly concerned in this book. At
the same time we should not forget that the Buddhists of Sri Lanka,
Burma, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, China, Korea, Japan,
Tibet, and Mongolia have all produced their own distinctive
literatures, and continued to do so right up to the present day.

Having briefly reviewed the development of the Buddha’s
teaching in the form of literary texts, I wish to turn in the next
chapter to the actual content of that teaching. In the first place
we shall focus on those basic principles which are presented in
the four Nikaya/Agama collections of the Buddha’s discourses
and have been assumed and taken for granted by the subsequent
Buddhist tradition.

Four Truths
The Disease, the Cause, the Cure, the Medicine

The orientation of the Buddha's teaching

What did the Buddha teach? The early siitras present the Bud-
dha’s teaching as the solution to a problem. This problem is the
fundamental problem of life. In Sanskrit and Pali the problem is
termed duhkha/dukkha, which can be approximately translated
as ‘suffering’. In a Nikaya passage the Buddha thus states that
he has always made known just two things, namely suffering and
the cessation of suffering.' This statement can be regarded as
expressing the basic orientation of Buddhism for all times and
all places. Its classic formulation is by way of ‘four noble truths’:
the truth of the nature of suffering, the truth of the nature of
its cause, the truth of the nature of its cessation, and the truth
of the nature of the path leading to its cessation. One of the
earliest summary statements of the truths is as follows:

This is the noble truth of suffering: birth is suffering, ageing is suffering,
sickness is suffering, dying is suffering, sorrow, grief, pain, unhappiness,
and unease are suffering; being united with what is not liked is suffer-
ing, separation from what is liked is suffering; not to get what one wants
is suffering; in short, the five aggregates of grasping are suffering.

This is the noble truth of the origin of suffering: the thirst for repeated
existence which, associated with delight and greed, delights in this and
that, namely the thirst for the objects of sense desire, the thirst for exist-
ence, and the thirst for non-existence.

This is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering: the complete fad-
ing away and cessation of this very thirst—its abandoning, relinquish-
ing, releasing, letting go.

This is the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffer-
ing: the noble eightfold path, namely right view, right intention, right

60 Four Truths

speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right
concentration.’

The temptation to understand these four ‘truths’ as function-
ing as a kind of Buddhist creed should be resisted; they do not
represent ‘truth claims’ that one must intellectually assent to on
becoming a Buddhist. Part of the problem here is the word
‘truth’. The word satya (Pali sacca) can certainly mean truth, but
it might equally be rendered as ‘real’ or ‘actual thing’. That is,
we are not dealing here with propositional truths with which we
must either agree or disagree, but with four ‘true things’ or ‘real-
ities’ whose nature, we are told, the Buddha finally understood
on the night of his awakening. The teachings of the Buddha thus
state that suffering, its cause, its cessation, and the path to its
cessation are realities which we fail to see as they are, and this
is as true for the ‘Buddhist’ as the ‘non-Buddhist’. The ‘Buddhist’
is simply one committed to trying to follow the Buddha’s pre-
scriptions for coming to see these realities as they are. This is not
to say that the Buddha’s discourses do not contain theoretical
statements of the nature of suffering, its cause, its cessation, and
the path to its cessation, but these descriptions function not so
much as dogmas of the Buddhist faith as a convenient concep-
tual framework for making sense of Buddhist thought.’ Thus
from one point of view any piece of Buddhist theory can be con-
sidered as to do with the analysis of one or other of the four truths.

The disease of suffering

The starting point of the Buddha’s teachings is, then, the reality
of suffering. Yet the summary statement of the first truth quoted
above should not be seen as seeking to persuade a world of other-
wise perfectly contented beings that life is in fact unpleasant. Rather
it addresses a basic fact of existence: sooner or later, in some form
or another, no matter what they do, beings are confronted by
and have to deal with duhkha. This is, of course, precisely the
moral of the tale of the Buddha’s early life in Kapilavastu: even
with everything one could possibly wish for, he had not found

Four Truths 61

true happiness as long as he and those dearest to him were prey
to disease, old age, and death. This is the actuality of duhkha.

Rich in meaning and nuance, the word duhkha is one of the
basic terms of Buddhist and other Indian religious discourse.
Literally ‘pain’ or ‘anguish’, in its religious and philosophical con-
texts duhkha is, however, suggestive of an underlying sense of
‘unsatisfactoriness’ or ‘unease’ that must ultimately mar even our
experience of happiness. Since any pleasant experience, whatever
its basis, is ultimately unreliable and subject to loss, if we rest
our hopes of final happiness in it we are bound to be disappointed.
Thus duhkha can be analysed in Buddhist thought by way of three
kinds: suffering as pain, as change, and as conditions.*

The first is self-evident suffering: when we are in mental or
physical pain there is no question that there is duhkha. Yet when
we are enjoying something, or even when there is nothing that
is causing us particular unhappiness, things are always liable to
change: what we were enjoying may be removed from us or
something unpleasant may manifest itself—this is duhkha as
change. In fact everything in the world, everything we experi-
ence, is changing moment by moment. Some things may change
very rapidly, some things extremely slowly, but still everything
changes, everything is impermanent (anitya/anicca). When we
begin to be affected by the reality of this state of affairs we may
find the things that previously gave us great pleasure are tainted
and no longer please us in the way they once did. The world
becomes a place of uncertainty in which we can never be sure
what is going to happen next, a place of shifting and unstable
conditions whose very nature is such that we can never feel
entirely at ease in it. Here we are confronted with duhkha ina
form that seems to be inherent in the nature of our existence
itself—duhkha as conditions. To put it another way, I may be
relaxing in a comfortable armchair after a long, tiring day, but
part of the reason I am enjoying it so much is precisely because
I had such a long, tiring day. How long will it be before I am
longing to get up and do something again—half an hour, an hour,
two hours? Or again, I may feel myself perfectly happy and
content; the suffering I hear about is a long way away, in another

62 Four Truths

town, in another country, on another continent. But how close
does it have to come before it in some sense impinges on my
own sense of well-being—the next street, the house next door,
the next room? That is, we are part of a world compounded of
unstable and unreliable conditions, a world in which pain and
pleasure, happiness and suffering are in all sorts of ways bound
up together. It is the reality of this state of affairs that the teach-
ings of the Buddha suggest we each must understand if we are
ever to be free of suffering.

On the basis of its analysis of the problem of suffering, some
have concluded that Buddhism must be judged a bleak, pessimistic
and world-denying philosophy. From a Buddhist perspective,
such a judgement may reflect a deep-seated refusal to accept
the reality of duhkha itself, and it certainly reflects a particular
misunderstanding of the Buddha’s teaching. The Buddha taught
four truths and, by his own standards, the cessation of suffering
and the path leading to its cessation are as much true realities
as suffering and its cause.

The growth of early Buddhism must be understood in the con-
text of the existence of a number of different ‘renouncer’ groups
who shared the view that ‘suffering’ in some sense characterizes
human experience, and that the quest for happiness is thus only
to be fulfilled by fleeing the world. Some historians have felt that
the emergence of such a view and its general acceptance in east-
ern India of the fourth and third centuries BCE requires a par-
ticular kind of explanation. In short, there must have been a lot
of suffering about. Various suggestions have been made, from
psychological unease caused by urbanization to the spread of dis-
ease.’ Whether or not such factors played a role, I am uncon-
vinced that as historians we are driven to seek such explanations,
for this is to conclude that the decisive historical determinants in
this case are the physical and mental well-being of society at large,
rather than individual personalities. An individual’s sense of suf-
fering need not be related to the amount of suffering in society as
a whole, nor even to the amount of suffering he or she has per-
sonally undergone. Nor am I convinced that the idea that suffering
in some sense characterizes human experience is so extraordinary

Four Truths 63

and culturally specific that it requires particular explanation; the
ancient Indian sage might protest with some justification:

Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:
This wide and universal theatre

Presents more woeful pageants than the scene
Wherein we play in.°

Historians seem prepared to accept that the Buddha was a
charismatic personality and something of a genius. That such an
individual might well have had a certain success in convincing
others of the soundness of his understanding of the nature of
the world, and that they in turn might have had considerable
influence on the overall cultural outlook does not seem to me
historically implausible.

It is worth noting, however, that the Buddhist tradition itself
makes certain observations concerning the circumstances in
which beings will be receptive to the teaching of duhkha. Accord-
ing to the understanding of traditional Buddhist cosmology
the universe comprises many different types of beings. Some
of these beings’ lives are so pleasurable that, although it is not
impossible for them to appreciate that their happiness is not
final or absolute, it is certainly difficult. On the other hand, other
beings are preoccupied with lives of such misery that coming to
understand the subtlety of the Buddha’s teaching is extremely
difficult. According to the ancient commentary to the Jataka,
it was the consideration of the circumstances in which beings
would be receptive to his teachings that the Bodhisattva took
into account when he was reflecting in the Tusita heaven on when
and where to be reborn for the last time and become a buddha
and teach Dharma.’

The Buddhist tradition has sometimes compared the Buddha
to a physician and the four truths to a medical diagnosis: the truth
of duhkha is like a disease, the truth of the origin of duhkha is
like its cause, the truth of the cessation of duhkha is like the dis-
ease’s being cured, and the truth of the path leading to the cessa-
tion of duhkha is like the medicine that brings about the disease’s
cure.® It is the wish to relieve the suffering of the disease and

64 Four Truths

eradicate its cause that is the starting point of Buddhist practice.
All this suggests something else that is fundamental to the ori-
entation of Buddhist thought and practice: the wish to relieve
suffering can in the end only be rooted in a feeling of sympathy
(anukampa) or compassion for the suffering of both oneself and
of others. This feeling of sympathy for the suffering of beings is
what motivates not only the Buddha to teach but ultimately every-
one who tries to put his teaching into practice.°

The Buddha’s teaching thus represents the medicine for the
disease of suffering. Or, according to the metaphor of the fourth
truth, it is the ‘path’ (marga/magga) or ‘way’ ( pratipad/patipada)
that one follows in order to reach the destination that is the
cessation of suffering. Or, as we saw in the previous chapter, it
is a system of training in conduct, meditation, and wisdom. If one
were to define Buddhism in keeping with this understanding,
it would have to be as a practical method for dealing with the
reality of suffering. Yet it is usual to classify Buddhism as ‘a reli-
gion’. Asked to define the meaning of the word religion, English
speakers would probably not immediately suggest ‘a practical
way of dealing with the reality of suffering’. Certainly this is not
the kind of definition we find in contemporary dictionaries. Yet
in the Indian cultural context this is essentially how many of the
traditions which we today generally class as ‘religious’ conceive
of themselves. One of the ancient and recurring images of Indian
religious discourse is of ‘crossing the ocean of existence’, that is,
crossing over from the near shore, which is fraught with dangers,
to the further shore, which is safe and free from danger. This
is equivalent to escaping or transcending the endless round of
rebirth that is samsdra and the condition of duhkha.

One contemporary dictionary definition of religion is as fol-
lows: ‘belief in, worship of or obedience to a supernatural power
or powers considered to be divine or to have control over human
destiny’.’° This is illustrative of a modern tendency to understand
religion as principally a kind of belief system—usually revolving
around a God who is both creator and saviour—that an individual
takes on board and which then provides him or her with a way
of looking at the world. Probably the reduction of religion to

Four Truths 65

this kind of belief system should be seen as a relatively recent
phenomenon—the legacy of the Reformation and the Enlight-
enment. Protestant theology tended to emphasize the primacy
of ‘faith’ over ‘works’; by seeming to expose the irrationality
of the theoretical beliefs regarded as the underpinnings of this
Christian faith, the post-Enlightenment traditions of philosophy
and science appeared about to cause the collapse of religion. All
this amounts to a modern preoccupation with particular beliefs
as the essence of religion. Arguably the very nature of Christianity
makes it predisposed to understanding itself as a particular set
of beliefs; nevertheless historically Christianity has clearly been
much more than its creeds—as much a question of adopting cer-
tain practices as of adopting beliefs. Theoretically the modern
academic study of religion should have made us all aware of the
multi-dimensional nature of religion, but cultural biases are not
so easily corrected in practice.'! Thus the tendency to understand
religion as primarily involving the adoption of particular kinds
of belief still informs what we expect ‘religions’ to be; this hinders
our understanding of Christianity, let alone of Judaism, Islam,
Hinduism, and Buddhism.

I am not concerned here to pronounce on a question that is
sometimes asked of Buddhism: is it a religion? Obviously it
depends on how one defines ‘a religion’. What is certain, how-
ever, is that Buddhism does not involve belief in a creator God
who has control over human destiny, nor does it seek to define
itself by reference to a creed; as Edward Conze has pointed
out, it took over 2,000 years and a couple of Western converts
to Buddhism to provide it with a creed.’ On the other hand,
Buddhism views activities that would be generally understood
as religious—such as devotional practices and rituals—as a legit-
imate, useful, and even essential part of the practice and train-
ing that leads to the cessation of suffering.

Buddhism regards itself as presenting a system of training
in conduct, meditation, and understanding that constitutes a
path leading to the cessation of suffering. Everything is to be
subordinated to this goal. And in this connection the Buddha’s
teachings suggest that preoccupation with certain beliefs and

66 Four Truths

ideas about the ultimate nature of the world and our destiny in
fact hinders our progress along the path rather than helping it.
If we insist on working out exactly what to believe about the world
and human destiny before beginning to follow the path of prac-
tice we will never even set out.

An important incident is related in the CaJa-Madlunkya Sutta
(‘short discourse to Malunkya’) and concerns ten matters that
are ‘unexplained’ or ‘undetermined’ (avyakrta/avyakata) by the
Buddha." These ten undetermined questions are as follows:
(1) is the world eternal or (2) is it not eternal? (3) is the world
finite or (4) is it infinite? (5) are the soul and the body one and
the same thing or (6) is the soul one thing and the body another?
(7) after death, does the Tathagata (i.e. a buddha or arhat) exist
or (8) does he not exist or (9) does he both exist and not exist
or (10) does he neither exist nor not exist? One evening, it seems,
the monk Malunkyaputta felt that he had been patient with the
Buddha long enough. Malunkyaputta went to the Buddha and
declared that unless he answered these questions or straight-
forwardly stated that the reason he did not answer them was
because he did not know the answers, he would abandon his
training under the Buddha. The Buddha responded by asking
Malunkyaputta a question: had he ever said to Malunkyaputta
that he should come and practise the spiritual life with him and
he would explain to him whether or not the world was eternal?
Malunkyaputta confessed that he had not. The Buddha then
suggested that whoever declared that he would not practise the
spiritual life with the Buddha until he had explained these ques-
tions would certainly die without the Buddha having explained
them; he then related a story of a man struck by an arrow.

It is as if there were a man struck by an arrow that was smeared thickly
with poison; his friends and companions, his family and relatives would
summon a doctor to see to the arrow. And the man might say, ‘I will
not draw out this arrow as long as I do not know whether the man by
whom I was struck was a brahmin, a ksatriya, a vaisya, or a Siidra... as
long as I do not know his name and his family . .. whether he was tall,
short or of medium height...’ That man would not discover these
things, but that man would die.'*

Four Truths 67

Why did the Buddha refuse to give categorical answers to these
questions? It has been claimed by some modern scholars that the
Buddha was simply not interested in metaphysical questions and
that he wished to leave these matters open.’ Such an interpreta-
tion seems to miss the point. The Buddha’s refusal to answer has
a philosophically more sophisticated and subtle basis. It is stated
in the Ciila-Malunkya Sutta that one of the reasons why he did
not explain these matters was because they were not connected
with the goal and purpose of the path, namely the cessation
of suffering; what the Buddha explained was just suffering, its
cause, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation. This leaves
no doubt as to the practical intent of the Buddha’s teaching,
but what precisely is being said about these questions when it is
declared that their explanation does not conduce to the cessa-
tion of suffering?

The Buddha might be suggesting that he neither knew the
answers to these questions nor was he interested in pursuing the
questions because he considered them irrelevant. Yet this is quite
definitely not the understanding of the later Buddhist tradition,
which tended to regard the Buddha as knowing everything; and
the Buddha of the earlier texts certainly never straightforwardly
admits to not knowing the answers to these questions. Thus if
we take this line we are driven to the conclusion that either the
Buddha himself or the authors of the early texts were embar-
rassed about his ignorance of these matters and sought to cover
it up. Alternatively the Buddha might have had answers to these
questions which he simply refused to divulge on the stated
grounds that it would not help his followers in their progress in
the training. Such a possibility might seem to be confirmed by
another tradition that reports the Buddha as once saying that there
were indeed many things which he knew and understood but
did not communicate on the grounds that they did not conduce
to the cessation of suffering.'° But the passage in question gives
no explicit indication that these ten questions are included in
this category of things the Buddha understands but does not
communicate. The third possibility would seem to be that these
questions are somehow by their very nature unanswerable. It

68 Four Truths

is fairly clear that this is indeed how the early texts and the
subsequent Buddhist tradition understand the matter.’7 The
reason why these questions are unanswerable concerns matters
that lie at the heart of Buddhist thought. In simple terms the
questions are unanswerable because they assume, as absolute,
categories and concepts—the world, the soul, the self, the
Tathagata—that the Buddha and the Buddhist tradition does not
accept or at least criticizes or understands in particular ways. That
is, from the Buddhist perspective these questions are ill-formed
and misconceived. To answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to any one of them is
to be drawn into accepting the validity of the question and the
terms in which it is couched—rather like answering ‘yes’ or ‘no’
to a question such as, ‘Are Martians green?’ One’s answer may
be construed in ways one had not intended. Thus the Buddha
tells the insistent Malunkyaputta that whichever one of these views
he might embrace, the real work remains:

It is not the case that one would live the spiritual life by virtue of hold-
ing the view that the world is eternal. Nor is it the case that one would
live the spiritual life by virtue of holding the view that the world is not
eternal. Whether one holds the view that the world is eternal, or whether
one holds the view that the world is not eternal, there is still birth,
ageing, death, grief, despair, pain, and unhappiness—whose destruction
here and now I declare.'*

In fact, such views (drsti/ditthi) about the ultimate nature of the
world are, from the Buddhist perspective, the expression of a men-
tal grasping which is but one manifestation of that insatiable ‘thirst’
or ‘craving’ which Buddhist thought regards as the condition for
the arising of suffering, and to which we will now turn.

The origin of suffering: attachment, aversion, and delusion

Why do beings suffer? What is the truth or reality of the origin
of suffering? At the outset it is worth drawing attention to a point
of contrast with the approach to suffering found in certain
traditional Jewish, Christian, and Islamic theologies. As we
have already seen, and shall see more clearly in Chapter 5, the
Buddhist understanding of the world is not based upon the

Four Truths 69

concept of a creator God—omnipotent or otherwise. Thus there
is no need in Buddhist thought to explain the existence of suf-
fering in the face of God’s omnipotence and boundless love. The
existence of suffering in the world is not to be related in some
way to God’s purpose in creating the world and, in particular,
mankind as in the traditional Christian theodicies of Augustine
and Ireneus. For Buddhist thought suffering is simply a fact of
existence, and in its general approach to the problem, Buddhist
thought suggests that it is beings themselves who must take
ultimate responsibility for their suffering. This may come as
rather depressing news, but on the other hand, to anticipate our
discussion of the third and fourth truths, precisely because our
suffering is something that we must each bear a certain respons-
ibility for, it is also something that we can do something about.

This way of looking at things has sometimes been perceived
by people brought up in an intellectual and cultural tradition in
part moulded by Christian thought as a rather bleak view of affairs,
contrasting with thé message of the saving Christ proclaimed
by Christianity. Yet it is important to appreciate that in its own
cultural context this is most definitely presented and perceived
as a message of hope. Furthermore this outlook of individual
responsibility does not entail that individuals are, as it were, for-
ever and absolutely ‘on their own’. On the contrary, the message
is precisely that help is at hand in the form of the Buddha’s teach-
ings and of those who have followed and are following the path.
Moreover, from a Buddhist perspective, the sense that one is
forever and absolutely on one’s own must rest in part on a self-
delusion from which one can be eventually released by the Bud-
dha’s teachings (see Chapter 6). With the Buddha’s awakening
‘the doors to the deathless’ are once more open for those who
have the faith to set out on the path.!? As John Ross Carter has
put it, there is no need of a saviour not because suffering human-
ity is its own saviour, but because of the efficacy of Dharma when
made the integral basis of one’s life.”°

So suffering is created by beings, but how? The summary de-
finition of the second truth states the condition for the arising of
suffering as ‘the thirst for repeated existence which, associated

70 Four Truths

with delight and greed, delights in this and that’; this is then
specified as ‘the thirst for the objects of sense desire, the thirst
for existence and the thirst for non-existence’. I have translated
the word trsnda (Pali: tanhd) as ‘thirst’. This is its literal meaning,
but in the present context it is a figurative word for strong desire
or craving. In fact trsnd or ‘thirst’ belongs to the corpus of Bud-
dhist technical vocabulary and has very specific meanings and
connotations. Thus ‘craving’, while certainly conveying a good
deal of the sense of ¢rsnd in Buddhist discourse, requires a cer-
tain amount of commentary and explication.

The suggestion is that deep in the minds of beings there is a
greed or desire that manifests as an unquenchable thirst which
is the principal condition for the arising of suffering. As the
summary quotation points out, this thirst or craving takes dif-
ferent forms: craving for the objects of the senses, for existence
and non-existence. It is the cause of suffering because it can never
be finally satisfied. This is clear with the objects of the senses:
pleasure based on these is always liable to be taken from us because
of their unstable and unreliable nature; on another level desire
for the objects of the senses has always the tendency to increase;
never content with what it has, it is always looking for new
objects to satisfy itself. But craving for the objects of the senses
is just a particular manifestation of craving. I may crave to be
some particular kind of person, or I may crave fame and even
immortality. On the other hand, I may bitterly and resentfully
turn my back on ambition, craving to be a nobody; I may
become depressed and long not to exist, wishing that I had never
been born; in this state I may even take my own life. I may
passionately believe that I possess an immortal soul and that I
will exist after death; or I may be absolutely certain in my con-
viction that death will be the final end, and that I shall die and
there will be no more of me. From the perspective of Buddhist
thought all these feelings, desires, and beliefs are the products
of the workings of trsnd, the workings of craving for existence
and non-existence. Yet in a world where everything is always
changing, in a world of shifting and unstable conditions, craving
of whatever kind will never be able to hold on to the things it
craves. This is the origin of suffering.

Four Truths 71

At first desires may be like the trickle of a stream, but they
grow into a river of craving which carries us away like the
current of a swiftly flowing river.”’ Craving is understood to
crystallize as ‘grasping’ or ‘attachment’ (upddana): the various
things we like evoke desires in us; these turn to cravings; as a
result of our craving we grasp at things and try to take posses-
sion of them; in short, we try to call them our own. Buddhist
texts provide a stock list of four kinds of attachment: attachment
to the objects of sense desire, attachment to views, attachment
to precepts and vows, attachment to the doctrine of the self.”
These suggest the complex and subtle network and web of attach-
ment that Buddhist thought sees as enmeshing beings.

The ultimately significant thing in all this is craving and at-
tachment rather than whatever is the object of that attachment
and craving. Thus it is not the objects of sense desire that cause
us suffering, but our attachment to those; it is not views, precepts
and vows, and the doctrine of self that in themselves cause suf-
fering but our attachment. This is not to say that all views, pre-
cepts and vows, and doctrines about the self are regarded as equal
in Buddhist thought. Certain attachments are most definitely
considered more harmful and more productive of suffering than
others. Thus an attachment to the first of the five Buddhist pre-
cepts, the precept of not harming living creatures, is not to be
considered as of the same order as an attachment to the habit of
killing creatures. Indeed, deliberately killing living creatures is
regarded as a particularly unwholesome act, and to the extent
that attachment to the precept of not harming living creatures
prevents us from killing, it is a positive good; nevertheless, as
long as it remains an attachment—an abstract principle we tena-
ciously’cling to—it too must remain a contributory cause of
duhkha. The problem is that we can become attached to even
useful and helpful things, even to the practice of the Buddha’s
teaching: :

‘It is as if there were a man who had set out on a long journey. He might
see a great river in flood, the near shore fearful and dangerous, the far
shore safe and free of danger, but there might be no ferry or bridge for
crossing from one side to the other. And this man might think, “This is
a great river in flood. The near shore is fearful and dangerous, the far

72 Four Truths

shore safe and free of danger, but there is no ferry or bridge to cross
from one side to the other. What if I were to gather together grass, sticks,
branches and foliage and bind together a raft, and then using that raft,
striving with my hands and feet, safely cross over to the further shore?”
Thereupon that man might gather together grass, sticks, branches and
foliage and bind together a raft, and then using that raft, striving with
his hands and feet he might safely cross over to the further shore. Once
he had crossed over it might occur to him, “This raft is very useful to
me. Using this raft, striving with my hands and feet I have safely crossed
over to the further shore. What if I were to now lift it on to my head
or raise it on my back and set off as I pleased?” What do you think of
this, monks? If the man did this with the raft would he be doing what
is appropriate?’

‘Not at all, lord.’

‘So what might this man do with the raft in order to do what is appro-
priate? In this case once he had crossed over it might occur to him, “This
raft is very useful to me. Using this raft, striving with my hands and feet,
I have safely crossed over to the further shore. What if I were now to
beach this raft on the shore or sink it in the water and go on my way as
I pleased?” The man who did this with the raft would be doing what is
appropriate. Even so, monks, as being like a raft, I have taught you how
Dharma is for the purpose of crossing over and not for the purpose of
holding on to. Those who understand the similarity to a raft will let go
even of the teachings and practices (dhamma), let alone what are not
the teachings and practices (adhamma)’.*

This does not mean that in relinquishing his or her attachment
to the precept of not harming living creatures the Buddhist saint
suddenly starts harming living creatures. Rather the Buddhist saint
does no harm to living creatures not out of attachment to some
precept or ethical principle he or she has undertaken to live by,
but because of rooting out any motivation that might move him
or her to want to harm living creatures. Thus as well as indicat-
ing the, as it were, horizontal range of craving and attachment,
Buddhist thought draws up a vertical hierarchy of attachment
which the Buddhist practitioner progressively relinquishes as he
or she follows the path.

Something of this hierarchy of attachments is indicated by the
ancient list of the ten ‘fetters’ or ‘bonds’ (samyojana) that bind

Four Truths 3

beings to suffering and the round of rebirth: the view of indi-
viduality, doubt, clinging to precepts and vows, sensual desire,
aversion, desire for form, desire for the formless, pride, agita-
tion, and ignorance. As we shall presently see, the practice of the
Buddhist path begins with the taking of ethical precepts aimed
at restraining particularly damaging kinds of behaviour; these
provide the basis for the cultivation of meditation practices that
bring the practitioner to direct experience of the subtle worlds
of ‘form’ and ‘the formless’. Nevertheless, as the list of the ten
fetters makes clear, attachment to both precepts and to the worlds
of form and the formless experienced in meditation must be relin-
quished for the end of the path to be fully realized.

The list of ten fetters includes four items that are not prima-
facie aspects of craving or attachment: doubt, aversion, agita-
tion, and ignorance. The psychological relationship of aversion
to craving is not hard to see. Unfulfilled craving and frustrated
attachment become the conditions for aversion, anger, depres-
sion, hatred, and cruelty and violence which are in themselves
quite manifestly unpleasant (duhkha as pain) and in turn bring
further suffering. But what about doubt, agitation, and ignorance?
Developed Buddhist thought understands these states as having
an important psychological relationship. Even in the absence of
craving and aversion, we view the world through a mind that is
often fundamentally unclear, unsettled, and confused. Not sur-
prisingly we fail to see things as they truly are. At this point it
begins to become quite apparent just how and why craving leads
to suffering. There is a discrepancy between our craving and the
world we live in, between our expectations and the way things
are. We want the world to be other than it is. Our craving is based
on a fundamental misjudgement of the situation; a judgement
that assumes that when our craving gets what it wants we will be
happy, that when our craving possesses the objects of its desire
we will be satisfied. But such a judgement in turn assumes a world
in which things are permanent, unchanging, stable, and reliable.
But the world is simply not like that. In short, in craving we fail
to see how things truly are, and in failing to see how things truly
are we crave. In other words craving goes hand in hand with a

714 Four Truths

fundamental ignorance and misapprehension of the nature of
the world.

Thus we can state the three fundamental defilements of the
mind according to Buddhist thought: greed (raga, lobha), aver-
sion (dvesa/dosa), and delusion (moha, avidy@/avijja). It is these
that combine and interact, that manifest in different ways and
result in duhkha. In this way the great focus of Buddhist thought
is the workings of the mind. The processes by which the mind
responds to its various stimuli to bring about either the arising
of duhkha or the path that leads towards the cessation of duhkha
is considered in Buddhist thought by way of a particularly im-
portant and significant teaching that I referred to in passing in
recounting the story of the Buddha’s awakening. This teach-
ing is known as ‘dependent arising’ or ‘dependent origination’
(pratitya-samutpdada/paticca-samuppada). Dependent arising is to
be understood as in certain respects an elaboration of the truth
of the origin of suffering, but this difficult teaching is intertwined
with other important themes of Buddhist thought and I shall
postpone its full explanation until Chapter 6.

The cessation of suffering: nirvana

In the normal course of events our quest for happiness leads us
to attempt to satisfy our desires—whatever they be. But in so
doing we become attached to things that are unreliable, unstable,
changing, and impermanent. As long as there is attachment to
things that are unstable, unreliable, changing, and impermanent
there will be suffering—when they change, when they cease to
be what we want them to be. Try as we might to find something
in the world that is permanent and stable, which we can hold on
to and thereby find lasting happiness, we must always fail. The
Buddhist solution is as radical as it is simple: let go, let go of every-
thing. If craving is the cause of suffering, then the cessation of
suffering will surely follow from ‘the complete fading away and
ceasing of that very craving’: its abandoning, relinquishing,
releasing, letting go. The cessation of craving is, then, the goal
of the Buddhist path, and equivalent to the cessation of suffer-
ing, the highest happiness, nirvana (Pali nibbana).

Four Truths 5

Nirvana is a difficult concept, but certain things about the
traditional Buddhist understanding of nirvana are quite clear. Some
of the confusion surrounding the concept arises, I think, from a
failure to distinguish different dimensions of the use of the term
nirvana in Buddhist literature. I want here to discuss nirvana in
terms of three things: (1) nirvana as, in some sense, a particular
event (what happens at the moment of awakening), (2) nirvana
as, in some sense, the content of an experience (what the mind
knows at the moment of awakening), and (3) nirvana as, in some
sense, the state or condition enjoyed by buddhas and arhats after
death. Let us examine this more closely.

Literally nirvana means ‘blowing out’ or ‘extinguishing’, although
Buddhist commentarial writings, by a play on words, like to
explain it as ‘the absence of craving’. But where English trans-
lations of Buddhist texts have ‘he attains nirvana/parinirvana’,
the more characteristic Pali or Sanskrit idiom is a simple verb:
‘he or she nirvana-s’ or more often ‘he or she parinirvana-s’
(parinibbayati). What the Pali and Sanskrit expression primarily
indicates is the event or process of the extinction of the ‘fires’
of greed, aversion, and delusion. At the moment the Buddha under-
stood suffering, its arising, its cessation, and the path leading to
its cessation, these fires were extinguished. This process is the same
for all who reach awakening, and the early texts term it either
nirvana or parinirvana, the complete ‘blowing out’ or ‘extinguish-
ing’ of the ‘fires’ of greed, aversion, and delusion. This is not a
‘thing’ but an event or experience.

After a being has, as it were, ‘nirvana-ed’, the defilements
of greed, hatred, and delusion no longer arise in his or her
mind, since they have been thoroughly rooted out (to switch to
another metaphor also current in the tradition). Yet like the
Buddha, any person who attains nirvana does not remain there-
after forever absorbed in some transcendental state of mind. On
the contrary he or she continues to live in the world; he or she
continues to think, speak, and act as other people do—with the
difference that all his or her thoughts, words, and deeds are com-
pletely free of the motivations of greed, aversion, and delusion,
and motivated instead entirely by generosity, friendliness, and
wisdom. This condition of having extinguished the defilements

76 Four Truths

can be termed ‘nirvana with the remainder [of life]’ (sopadhisesa-
nirvana/sa-upadisesa-nibbana): the nirvana that comes from end-
ing the occurrence of the defilements (klesa/kilesa) of the mind;
what the Pali commentaries call for short kilesa-parinibbana.* And
this is what the Buddha achieved on the night of his awakening.

Eventually ‘the remainder of life’ will be exhausted and, like
all beings, such a person must die. But unlike other beings,
who have not experienced ‘nirvana’, he or she will not be reborn
into some new life, the physical and mental constituents of being
will not come together in some new existence, there will be
no new being or person. Instead of being reborn, the person
‘parinirvana-s’, meaning in this context that the five aggregates
of physical and mental phenomena that constitute a being cease
to occur. This is the condition of ‘nirvana without remainder [of
life)’ (nir-upadhisesa-nirvana/an-upadisesa-nibbana): nirvana that
comes from ending the occurrence of the aggregates (skandha/
khandha) of physical and mental phenomena that constitute a
being; or, for short, khandha-parinibbana.> Modern Buddhist
usage tends to restrict ‘nirvana’ to the awakening experience and
reserve ‘parinirvana’ for the death experience.”

So far we have considered nirvana from the perspective of a
particular experience which has far-reaching and quite specific
effects. This is the more straightforward aspect of the Buddhist
tradition’s understanding of nirvana. There is, however, a fur-
ther dimension to the tradition’s treatment and understand-
ing of nirvana. What precisely does the mind experience at the
moment when the fires of greed, hatred and delusion are finally
extinguished? At the close of one of the works of the Pali canon
entitled Udana there are recorded several often quoted ‘inspired
utterances’ (uddna) said to have been made by the Buddha
concerning nirvana. Here is the first:

There is, monks, a domain where there is no earth, no water, no fire,
no wind, no sphere of infinite space, no sphere of nothingness, no
sphere of infinite consciousness, no sphere of neither awareness nor
non-awareness; there is not this world, there is not another world, there
is no sun or moon. I do not call this coming or going, nor standing,

Four Truths 17

nor dying, nor being reborn; it is without support, without occurrence,
without object. Just this is the end of suffering.”

This passage refers to the four elements that constitute the phys-
ical world and also what the Buddhist tradition sees as the most
subtle forms of consciousness possible, and suggests that there
is a ‘domain’ or ‘sphere’ (dyatana) of experience of which these
form no part. This ‘domain’ or ‘sphere’ of experience is nirvana.
It may also be referred to as the ‘unconditioned’ (asamskrta/
asamKhata) or ‘unconditioned realm’ (asamskrta-/asamkhata-
dhatu) in contrast to the shifting, unstable, conditioned realms
of the round of rebirth. For certain Abhidharma traditions, at
the moment of awakening, at the moment of the extinguishing
of the fires of greed, hatred, and delusion, the mind knows this
unconditioned realm directly. In the technical terminology of the
Abhidharma, nirvana can be said to be the object of conscious-
ness at the moment of awakening when it sees the four truths.”
Thus in the moment of awakening when all craving and attach-
ments are relinquished, one experiences the profoundest and ulti-
mate truth about the world, and that experience is not of ‘a
nothing’—the mere absence of greed, hatred, and delusion—but
of what can be termed the ‘unconditioned’.

We can, then, understand nirvana from three points of view:
(1) it is the extinguishing of the defilements of greed, hatred,
and delusion; (2) it is the final condition of the Buddha and
arhats after death consequent upon the extinction of the defile-
ments; (3) it is the unconditioned realm known at the moment
of awakening. The critical question becomes the exact definition
of the ontological status of (2) and (3). The earlier tradition tends
to shy away from such definition, although, as we have seen,
it is insistent on one point: one cannot say that the arhat after
death exists, does not exist, both exists and does not exist, nei-
ther exists nor does not exist. The ontological status of nirvana
thus defies neat categorization and is ‘undetermined’ (avyakrta/
avyakata). None the less the followers of Sarvastivada Abhidharma
argue that nirvana should be regarded as ‘real’ (dravya), while
followers of the Theravada state that it should not be said to be

78 Four Truths

‘non-existence’ (abhava). But for the Sautrantikas, even this is
to say too much: one should not say more than that nirvana is
the absence of the defilements.”” With the development of the
Mahayana philosophical schools of Madhyamaka and Yogacara
we find attempts to articulate the ontology of nirvana in different
terms—the logic of ‘emptiness’ (Siinyata) and non-duality (advaya).

In the face of this some early Western scholarship concluded
that there was no consensus in Buddhist thought on the nature
of nirvana, or persisted in arguing either that nirvana was mere
annihilation or that it was some form of eternal bliss.*° If one
examines Buddhist writings one will find material that can be inter-
preted in isolation to support the view that nirvana amounts to
annihilation (the five aggregates of physical and mental phenom-
ena that constitute a being are gone and the arhat is no longer
reborn), and material to support the view that it is an eternal
reality. But this is not the point; the Buddhist tradition knows
this. The reason why both kinds of material are there is not because
the Buddhist tradition could not make up its mind. For, as we
have seen, the tradition is clear on one point: nirvana, as the post-
mortem condition of the Buddha and arhats, cannot be char-
acterized as non-existence, but nor can it be characterized as
existence. In fact to characterize it in either of these. ways is to
fall foul of one of the two basic wrong views (drsti/ditthi) between
which Buddhist thought tries to steer a middle course: the anni-
hilationist view (uccheda-vada) and the eternalist view (Sasvata-/
sassata-vada). Thus although the schools of Buddhist thought may
articulate the ontology of nirvana in different terms, one thing
is clear, and that is that they are always attempting to articulate
the middle way between existence and non-existence, between
annihilationism and eternalism. And it is in so far as any for-
mulation of nirvana’s ontolgy is judged to have failed to main-
tain the delicate balance necessary to walk the middle path that
it is criticized. Of course, whether any of Buddhist thought’s
attempts at articulating the ontology of the middle way will
be judged philosophically successful is another question. And
again the tradition seems on occasion to acknowledge even this.
Although some of the things one might say about nirvana will

Four Truths 719

certainly be more misleading than others, ultimately whatever
one says will be misleading; the last resort must be the ‘silence
of the Aryas’, the silence of the ones who have directly known
the ultimate truth, for ultimately ‘in such matters syllables,
words and concepts are of no use’.?!

What remains after all is said—and not said—is the reality of
nirvana as the goal of the Buddhist path conveyed not so much
by the attempt to articulate it philosophically but by metaphor.
Thus although strictly nirvana is no place, no abode where beings
can be said to exist, the metaphor of nirvana as the destination
at the end of the road remains vivid: ‘the country of No-Birth—
the city of Nibbana, the place of the highest happiness, peaceful,
lovely, happy, without suffering, without fear, without sickness,
free from old age and death’.

As if, monks, a person wandering in the forest, in the jungle, were to
see an ancient path, an ancient road along which men of old had gone.
And he would follow it,.and as he followed it he would see an ancient
city, an ancient seat of kings which men of old had inhabited, possess-
ing parks, gardens, lotus ponds, with high walls—a delightful place .. .
Just so, monks, I saw an ancient path, the ancient road along which the
fully awakened ones of old had gone... I followed it and following it
I knew directly old-age and death, the arising of old-age and death, the
ceasing of old-age and death and the path leading to the ceasing of old
age and death.*> :

So let us now turn to the path that leads to the city of nirvana.

The way leading to the cessation of suffering

So far in this chapter we have seen that Buddhist thought starts
from the premiss that life presents us with the problem of suf-
fering. The schema of the four truths analyses the nature of the
problem, its cause, its solution and the way to effect that solu-
tion. The first three truths primarily concern matters of Buddhist
theory; with the fourth truth we come to Buddhist practice pro-
per. That is, the first three truths provide a framework for the
application of the Buddhist solution to the problem of suffering.

80 Four Truths

The second truth suggests that we must recognize that the mind
has deep-rooted tendencies to crave the particular experiences
it likes, and that this craving is related to a fundamental misap-
prehension of ‘the way things are’: the idea that lasting happi-
ness is related to our ability to have, to possess and take hold of,
these experiences we like. In a world where everything is con-
stantly changing beyond our control, such an outlook brings us
not the happiness we seek, but discontent. Thus the third truth
suggests that lasting happiness lies in the stopping of craving and
grasping, in the rooting-out of greed, aversion, and delusion. Of
course, these latter mental forces are varied and psychologically
subtle; we can get caught in the trap of craving not to crave—
of desiring what is, in a sense, desireless, namely nirvana. Yet
as long as we crave nirvana or the cessation of suffering, then
by definition the object of our craving is not nirvana, not the
‘reality’ of the cessation of suffering, but a mere idea of what we
imagine nirvana, the cessation of suffering, to be like. Nirvana
is precisely the ceasing of all craving, so even the craving for
nirvana must be rooted out and eventually abandoned. The
fourth truth is concerned with the practical means for bringing
this about. But, as I have already suggested, from the perspect-
ive of the path certain cravings are less harmful than others
and, to an extent, even necessary to progress along the path.
Ultimately, however, as the simile of the raft indicates, attach-
ment to even the teachings and practices of Buddhism must be
relinquished.

According to Buddhist thought, just as there are various
defilements of the mind—principally greed, hatred, and delusion
—so there are various wholesome (kuSala/kusala) qualities of
the mind. As well as greed, hatred, and delusion there are then
their opposites, namely non-attachment (alobha), loving kind-
ness (advesa/adosa, maitri/metta), and wisdom (prajna/panna).
Were it not for these there would be no way of breaking out
of the cycle of greed, hatred, and delusion, and thus no path
leading to the cessation of duhkha. The principal, if not only, aim
of the Buddhist path is to develop and cultivate (bhavayati/
bhaveti) these and related wholesome qualities.

In the earliest Buddhist texts the noble truth of the path to
the cessation of suffering is most frequently summed up as the
‘noble eightfold path’: ‘perfect’, ‘right’, or ‘appropriate’ (samyak/
samma) view, intention, speech, conduct, livelihood, effort, mind-
fulness, and concentration. The basic meaning of these eight items
is clearly explained in a number of places in the early Buddhist
texts (see Table 1), but the interpretation of the overall struc-
ture of the eightfold path is perhaps not so straightforward.* We
all have certain views, ideas, beliefs, and opinions about ourselves,
others, and the world (1); depending on these we turn towards
the world with various intentions and aspirations (2); depending
on these we speak (3), act (4), and generally make our way in
the world (5). So far so good, but the meaning of the last three

82 Four Truths

items of the eightfold path is not so transparent. Effort (6),
mindfulness (7), and concentration (8) are in effect technical terms
of Buddhist meditation practice whose expression in everyday
language is less obvious. In practice they relate to one’s under-
lying state of mind or, perhaps better, emotional state. In other
words, the list of eight items suggests that there is a basic rela-
tionship between one’s understanding, one’s actions, and one’s
underlying emotional state.

The eight items of the path are not, however, to be understood
simply as stages, each one being completed before moving on to
the next. In fact, when we look at the extensive treatment of the
eightfold path in Buddhist literature, it becomes apparent that
view, intention, speech, conduct, livelihood, effort, mindfulness,
and concentration are presented here as eight significant dimen-
sions of one’s behaviour—mental, spoken, and bodily—that are
regarded as operating in dependence on one another and as
defining a complete way (marga/magga) of living.* The eight
items are significant in that they focus on the manner in which
what one thinks, says, does, and feels can effect—and affect—
the unfolding of the path to the cessation of suffering. Ordinarily
these eight aspects of one’s way of life may, at different times,
be either ‘right’ and ‘appropriate’ (samyak/samma) or ‘wrong’
and ‘inappropriate’ (mithya/miccha); that is, they may either
be out of keeping with the nature of things, leading one further
away from the cessation of suffering, or they may be in keeping
with the nature of things, bringing one closer to the cessation of
suffering. By means of Buddhist practice the eight dimensions
are gradually and collectively transformed and developed, until
they are established as ‘right’, such that they constitute the ‘noble’
(Grya/ariya) eightfold path. Strictly, then, the noble eightfold
path represents the end of Buddhist practice; it is the way of
living achieved by Buddhist saints—the stream-attainers, once-
returners, non-returmers, arhats, and bodhisattvas who have worked
on and gradually perfected view, intention, speech, conduct,
livelihood, effort, mindfulness, and concentration. For such as
these, having perfect view, intention, speech, action, livelihood,
endeavour, mindfulness, and concentration is not a matter of

Four Truths 83

trying to make their behaviour conform to the prescriptions of
the path, but simply of how they are in all they think, say, and
do. We are talking of an inner transformation at the deepest
levels of one’s being.

Alongside the eightfold path, Buddhist texts present the path
that ends in the cessation of suffering as a gradual and cumu-
lative process involving a hierarchical progression of practice,
beginning with generosity (dana), moving on to good conduct
(sila/Sila), and ending in meditation (bhdvana); alternatively we
find the sequence: good conduct (Sila/sila), meditative concen-
tration (samadhi), and wisdom (prajfa/panna). According to this
kind of scheme, the early stages of the practice of the path are
more concerned with establishing good conduct on the basis of
the ethical precepts; these provide the firm foundation for the
development of concentration, which in turn prepares for the per-
fection of understanding and wisdom. This outlook is the basis
of the important notion of ‘the gradual path’ which finds its earli-
est and most succinct expression as ‘the step by step discourse’
(anuparvika katha/anupubbi-katha) of the Nikayas/Agamas:

Then the Blessed One gave instruction step by step . . . namely talk on
giving, talk on good conduct, and talk on heaven; he proclaimed the
danger, elimination and impurity of sense desires, and the benefit of desire-
lessness. When the Blessed One knew that the mind [of his listener] was
ready, open, without hindrances, inspired, and confident, then he gave
the instruction in Dharma that is special to buddhas: suffering, its ori-
gin, its cessation, the path.*

The psychological understanding that underlies this is not hard
to see. In order to see the four truths, the mind must be clear
and still; in order to be still, the mind must be content; in. order
to be content, the mind must be free from remorse and guilt; in
order to be free from guilt, one needs a clear conscience; the bases
of a clear conscience are generosity and good conduct.

The eight items of the eightfold path can also be analysed in
terms of the three categories of good conduct, concentration,
and wisdom: the first two items of the path (view and intention)
are encompassed by the third category, wisdom; the next three

84 Four Truths

(speech, action, and livelihood) by the first category, good con-
duct; and the final three (effort, mindfulness, and concentration)
by the second category, meditative concentration.?’ That the
sequence of the items of the path does not conform to the order
of these three categories of practice highlights an understanding
of the spiritual life that sees all three aspects of practice as,
although progressive, none the less interdependent and relevant
to each and every stage of Buddhist practice. The practice of the
path is not simply linear; in one’s progress along the path it is
not that one first exclusively practises good conduct and then,
when one has perfected that, moves on to meditative concen-
tration and finally wisdom. Rather the three aspects of the prac-
tice of the path exist, operate, and are developed in a mutually
dependent and reciprocal relationship. In other words, without
some nascent sense of suffering and what conduces to its cessa-
tion one would not and could not even begin the practice of the
path. This is not necessarily a conscious understanding capable
of being articulated in terms of Buddhist doctrine, but is perhaps
just a sense of generosity and good conduct as in some way
constituting ‘good’ or wholesome (kuSala/kusala) behaviour—
behaviour that is in accordance with Dharma and conduces to
the cessation of suffering for both oneself and others. The details
of the cultivation of the path to the cessation of suffering form
the subject matter of Chapter 7, but let us now turn to consider
Buddhist practice more generally: the way of life of Buddhist
monks, nuns, and lay followers.

The Buddhist Community
Monks, Nuns, and Lay Followers

The Buddha's followers and the origin of the Buddhist order

As we saw in Chapter 1, Buddhism grew out of the ancient
Indian ‘renouncer’ tradition; the Buddha’s own teachers were
such renouncers, as were those to whom he first addressed his
teachings. Thus in presenting a system of training and practice
geared to the eradication of greed, aversion, and delusion as
the root causes of suffering, the Buddha’s teaching suggests that
the ideal basis for this training is the way of life followed by the
Buddha himself, the life of a homeless, mendicant wanderer—
in short, the life of a Buddhist monk (bhiksu/bhikkhu) or nun
(bhiksunt/bhikkhuni). Indeed, while the earliest texts allow that
one may achieve full awakening and arhatship without first
formally becoming a monk, an old tradition argues that in such
a case one inevitably either joins the Buddhist order or dies the
same day.!

The basis of the renouncer’s lifestyle lies in two things: (1) re-
nunciation of the household life for the sake of the religious
life, and (2) dependence upon the generosity of the population
at large for the provision of material needs—food, clothing, and
dwellings. The success of early Buddhism thus assumes both a
desire on the part of certain members of the population to give
up ‘normal society’ or ‘the household life’, and sufficient good
will on the part of those remaining in normal society to allow
them to do so. The followers of a teacher such as the Buddha
thus fell into two socially distinct categories: homeless wanderers
and lay supporters. Buddhist texts talk of the four ‘assemblies’
(parisat/parisa): of monks, nuns, male lay followers, female lay
followers.

86 The Buddhist Community

Buddhists have, then, always understood the Buddha’s mes-
sage not only as an invitation to give up the household life and
join the Buddha’s group of monks, but also as an invitation to
the wider community to support the religious life. The Buddhist
understanding of the nature of the lifestyle of ‘one gone forth’
sees the Buddhist monastic community as a significant part of
society as a whole. Thus when the Buddha is reported, shortly
after his awakening, as instructing his growing group of newly
‘awakened’ monastic followers to set off, never two by the same
way, to teach Dharma that is ‘lovely in the beginning, lovely in
the middle, and lovely in the end’, ‘for the benefit and happiness
of the many, out of sympathy for the world, for the good, bene-
fit, and happiness of gods and men’, this represents more than
simply a recruitment drive for the Sangha or Order of monks
and nuns.’ The presence of Buddhist monks and nuns within a
society has been seen as in itself a positive good and of benefit
for all. Let us turn now to consider the members of the assem-
blies of the monks and nuns.

The procedures governing ordination, along with the rule
governing life as a Buddhist monk or nun, are set out in the
Vinaya, the division of Buddhist scriptures devoted to monastic
‘discipline’. As we saw in Chapter 2, a number of different
versions of this survive from ancient times. Only three are in
actual use today. In Sri Lanka and South-East Asia monks in
principle follow the rule of the Pali Theravadin Vinaya; in East
Asia (China, Korea, and Japan) monks follow the rule of the
ancient Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, translated into Chinese from
an Indian original in the fifth century; in Tibet and Mongolia
monks follow the rule of the Milasarvastivada, a branch of the
Sarvastivada school, translated into Tibetan in the ninth century.?
The Vinayas fall into two basic parts: (1) a set of rules governing
the life of the individual monk or nun known as the pratimoksa
(Pali patimokkha); and (2) regulations concerning the communal
ceremonies and corporate ‘acts’ of the Sangha (i.e. an ‘act’ that
is confirmed after having been formally proposed before a chap-
ter of the Sangha either just once or three times, depending on
the type of proposal), beginning with admission to the order.*

While there is considerable variation in the details of the surviv-
ing Vinayas, there is a fundamental agreement in structure and
core content.

Ordination and the Buddhist monastic ideal

According to tradition, becoming a Buddhist monk could ini-
tially be accomplished without much ceremony; ‘going forth’
(pravrajya/pabbajja)—from the household life into homelessness
—and ‘ordination’ (upasampada) involved only a request to the
Buddha and its acceptance by him with the words, ‘Come, monk.
Well taught is the Dharma. Live the spiritual life for the complete
ending of suffering.” Subsequently ‘going forth’ and ordina-
tion proper were distinguished as two distinct ceremonies; by
undergoing the former ceremony of pravrajya one becomes a
‘novice’ (Sramanera/samanera), while the latter ceremony of
upasampada renders one a bhiksu proper.® The ordination and
discipline of the Buddhist nun (bhiksuni/bhikkhuni) follows essen-
tially the same pattern.

The Theravadin Vinaya specifies that the candidate for pra-
vrajya must be old enough to scare crows away, usually taken as
meaning 7 or 8.” Going forth involves formally requesting that
a monk of at least ten years’ standing becomes one’s preceptor
(upadhyaya/upajjhaya) and teacher (acarya/acariya). The novice’s
head is shaved, and he puts on ochre robes. He then recites the
formula of going for refuge to the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha,
and takes the ten precepts or ‘rules of training’ (Siksa-/sikkha-pada):
(1) to refrain from harming living creatures, (2) to refrain from
taking what is not given, (3) to refrain from all sexual activity,
(4) to refrain from false speech, (5) to refrain from intoxicants
that cause heedlessness, (6) to refrain from eating after midday,
(7) to refrain from attending entertainments, (8) to refrain from
wearing jewellery or using perfumes, (9) to refrain from sleeping
on luxurious beds, (10) to refrain from handling gold and silver.®

One becomes a candidate for full ordination at the age of 20.°
The upasampada ceremony requires the participation of at least
five properly ordained bhiksus of at least ten years’ standing. For

88 The Buddhist Community

someone over the age of 20 the pravrajyda and the upasampada
may be performed together at one occasion.

At the end of his ordination ceremony a Buddhist monk is
informed that the four basic ‘resources’ (nifraya/nissaya) that
he can count on for the four ‘requisites’ (pariskara/parikkhara)
of food, clothing, lodging, and medicine are food offered to him
as alms, robes made of discarded rags, the foot of a tree, and
fermented urine respectively. Another list of requisites allows
the monk eight items as his personal possessions: three robes, an
alms-bowl, a razor, a needle, a belt, and a water-strainer.

The ideal of the Buddhist monk then is of one who steps out
from ordinary society: his appearance is different (his head is
shaved and he wears monastic robes); he renounces the ordinary
household life of wife, children, and family and takes a vow of
complete sexual abstinence; in adopting the way of life of the
monk he abandons any profession or means of livelihood; his per-
sonal possessions are minimal and for the little he can expect in
the way of creature comforts he is dependent on the generosity
of others.

While in the course of the Sangha’s long history in India and
beyond there has been some adaptation and local variations
have developed, the basic pattern of ordination set out in the
Vinaya remains relevant to the monastic traditions of Theravada
Buddhism, East Asian Buddhism, and Tibetan Buddhism.'° The
most visible variation is that Theravadin monks wear orange or
brown robes, while the monks of East Asia wear grey or black
robes, and the monks of Tibet wear maroon robes. In Tibet (and
sometimes in China) there has been a tendency for a consider-
able proportion of the Sangha to remain as sra@maneras and
never take full ordination."' In China pravrajya ordination has
been extended by separating initial tonsure, sometimes by many
years, from formal taking of the ten precepts, while higher
ordination has usually involved, in addition to the rules of the
pratimoksa, taking the fifty-eight ‘bodhisattva vows’ set out in
the Chinese ‘Brahma’s Net’ siitra (Fan-Wang-Ching).'* In South-
East Asia temporary ordination as a monk for a year or even
just a few months has become widespread.

The Buddhist Community 89

After upasampada one becomes a bhiksu—a Buddhist monk
proper—and as such one’s life is governed by the complete set
of rules which constitute the pratimoksa. The precise number
of rules that make up the monk’s pratimoksa varies; for the
Theravada there are 227 rules, for the Milasarvastivada (followed
by the Tibetans) there are 258, for the Dharmaguptakas (followed
in East Asia) there are 250, but the basic structure of the rules
and the individual rules involving serious offences are held in
common. In principle the rules simply elaborate a way of life based
on keeping the ten precepts of the novice, distinguishing between
serious and less serious breaches of these precepts. In this way
the rules fall into eight categories. Four offences involve ‘defeat’
(parajika), i.e. expulsion from the safigha: sexual intercourse, tak-
ing what is not given, killing another human being, and falsely
laying claim to spiritual attainments of any sort.'* These four
parajika offences map out the theoretical basis of the monastic
way of life: celibacy and reliance on the generosity of lay sup-
port. The failure to keep his vow of celibacy undermines one
of the defining characteristics of the Buddhist monk: he has
renounced the ordinary ‘household’ life of wife, children, and fam-
ily; furthermore sexual abstinence is associated with channelling
one’s energies towards spiritual attainments. To seek to solve
the problem of suffering by killing other human beings is the
grossest manifestation of greed, hatred, and delusion. To take
from society what is not freely given betrays the fundamental
relationship of trust between the monk, who undertakes to live
the life of the ascetic wanderer, and those who in good faith offer
their material support. Since any monk thought to be spiritually
accomplished is likely to become the object of lay admiration and
even devotion, to lie about spiritual attainments equally betrays
the trust of lay supporters.

The second category of rules comprises thirteen samghavasesa
(Pali samghddisesa) offences which are punishable by a period
of probation involving loss of full status as a member of the Sangha;
these involve sexual impropriety of various sorts, as well as
the building of certain types of dwelling, making false accusa-
tions, promoting schism in the Sangha, refusing to accept the

90 The Buddhist Community

admonishments of the Sangha, and corrupting families. The
thirteen samghdvaSesas are followed by two further rules con-
cerning charges of possible sexual impropriety whose penalty is
not fixed but must be determined by the Sangha according to
circumstances. Next come thirty nihsargika (Pali nissaggiya) rules
which mostly concern inappropriate use of robes, rugs, money,
bowls, and medicines; the offence should be confessed and the
item given up. A further ninety or ninety-two minor pdayantika
(Pali pdcittiya) rules prohibit various kinds of lying, physical
violence, and abusive speech, as well as further regulating the
use of the monk’s requisites, and his conduct in a monastery or
in the presence of women; breach of these rules only requires
confession. A further four miscellaneous offences merely require
confession (prdatidesaniya/patidesaniya). The category of minor
rules of training (Saiksa/sekhiya) varies from 66 to 113, de-
pending on the recension of the Vinaya, and covers the general
decorum and manners of a monk as he eats, walks, dresses, and
so forth. The bhiksu’s pratimoksa concludes with seven rules
concerned with the settling of disputes. Traditionally all mem-
bers of the Sangha in a given locality gather on the fortnightly
posadha (Pali uposatha) days—the days of the new and full moon
—to recite the rules that make up the pratimoksa and to confess
any breaches.

A note on Buddhist nuns

Tradition relates how the nuns’ or bhiksunis’ order was founded
after a request to the Buddha from Ananda on behalf of women
wanting to take up the spiritual life.‘ On that occasion the Bud-
dha explained his reluctance to ordain women not because he
regarded them as incapable of attaining arhatship, but because
their ordination would hasten the decline of the Dharma. This
attitude has often been interpreted as betraying a negative view
of women, although in part it might be read simply as reflecting
a realistic view of what happens when men and women who have
undertaken the celibate life live in close proximity. None the less,
the Buddha is represented as laying down eight special rules (garu-
dhamma) subordinating the nuns’ order to that of the monks.

The Buddhist Community gI

However, it has been argued on the grounds of inconsistencies
in the nuns’ Vinaya that these eight rules represent a later inter-
polation.’> Otherwise the pratimoksa of Buddhist nuns is similar
in broad outline to that of the monks, although in all recensions
it comprises rather more rules.

The Buddhist canon contains a whole collection of verses,
the Therigathd, attributed to female arhats as well as numerous
examples of accomplished female religious teachers. At the same
time, while allowing that women may become arhats, a canonical
tradition represents the Buddha as denying that it was possible
that a woman could be a buddha; the same passage also denies
the possibility of a woman’s being Mara.’* Of course, such an under-
standing assumes also the reality of rebirth; the status of Mara
or Buddha is thus not denied finally to any being since a being
born as a woman—or a Brahma (who is strictly without sex)—
in one life may be born as a man in another. Inscriptional evid-
ence from the early centuries CE points to the active role of both
Buddhist nuns and lay women.’”

At some point the Theravada order of nuns died out, per-
haps as early as the eleventh century in Sri Lanka, while the full
nun’s ordination lineage may never even have been established
in Tibet. This means that fully ordained Buddhist nuns are only
found today within East Asian Buddhism. Nevertheless, in the
Theravada and Tibetan traditions a significant number of women
still effectively live as nuns by permanently keeping the ten pre-
cepts of the novice nun or the eight precepts of the committed
female lay disciple; some continue to be regarded as respected
teachers of meditation.'* There is a movement to re-establish the
bhikkhuni ordination lineage in Theravada Buddhism, although
the attitude of some ‘nuns’ towards this is ambivalent, since full
ordination as a bhikkhuni brings with it the eight special rules
mentioned above.

The underlying concerns of the Vinaya

It is possible, I think, to identify four particular concerns in the
Buddhist monastic rule as set out in Vinaya: (1) the unity and

92 The Buddhist Community

cohesion of the Sangha, (2) the spiritual life, (3) the dependence
of the Sangha upon the wider community, and (4) the appear-
ance of the Sangha in the eyes of that community. These require
some elaboration.

The Buddhist monastic community is the prerequisite for the
existence of Buddhism in a given society. As we saw in Chap-
ter 2, in a traditional Buddhist society it is only through contact
with the monastic community that laity can have any knowledge
of the Buddha’s teachings. The Sangha lives the teaching, pre-
serves the teaching as scriptures, and teaches the wider commun-
ity. Without the Sangha there is no Buddhism. The Vinaya thus
attempts to provide a framework which renders the Sangha a
stable and viable institution, showing considerable concern for
unity and the settling of disputes. The Sangha’s constitution as
set out in the Vinaya provides for no formal head or leader;
authority rests in the agreement and consensus of bodies of
senior monks. The formal hierarchy of the Sangha is based on
seniority calculated from the time and date of one’s ordination.
The existence and survival of the Sangha for well over two
millennia in diverse cultures is a measure of the Vinaya’s suc-
cess in establishing a structure that is tight enough to prevent
disintegration of the community, but flexible enough to allow for
adaptation to particular circumstances.

If the life as a monk is fundamental to the Buddhist vision of
the spiritual life, then it follows that one of the Vinaya’s prime
concerns must be to regulate a way of life that conduces to the
realization of the Buddhist path. The Vinaya’s success in this
respect is perhaps harder to gauge; there are, alas, no stat-
istics for the number of realized ‘saints’—bodhisattvas, stream-
attainers, once-returners, never-returners, and arhats—it has
fostered. Yet the widespread view that, for example, the Thai
monk Acharn Mun who died in 1949 was an arhat indicates that
‘enlightenment’ is still regarded by some as a realistic aspiration
for the Buddhist monk, even if the prevalent attitude in some
circles is that arhatship is no longer possible.’® The sanctity, or
otherwise, of past and present members of the Sangha is hardly
a matter to be determined by academic enquiry; nevertheless the

The Buddhist Community 93

Vinaya’s concern with the minutiae of a monk’s handling of the
requisites exhibits an awareness of human foibles as well as of
the mind’s ingenuity and even deviousness in the face of rules
and regulations designed to curb greed, aversion, and delusion.
Anyone genuinely attempting to put this way of life into prac-
tice is very soon likely to be made aware of the multifarious
ways in which his or her greed, aversion, and delusion work.
Furthermore the number of minor rules concerning more gen-
eral behaviour seem intended to make for a certain alertness
or mindfulness, one of the mental qualities to be cultivated in
meditation.

The final two concerns of the Vinaya—the dependence of
the Sangha upon the wider community, and the appearance of
the Sangha in the eyes of that community—are interlinked. The
Buddhist monk may be one who renounces society, but the
genius of the Vinaya is that having invited the monk to give
up society it then requires him to live in dependence upon it,
thereby forcing him back into a relationship with it. It has
sometimes been suggested that the Buddha originally intended
to institute only a movement of committed ascetics removed
from society; these are the true and original Buddhists. From
this perspective the involvement of lay followers represents
something of an afterthought on the part of the Buddha. If the
basic conception of the Vinaya is attributable to the Buddha
himself, then such an interpretation is hardly sustainable, for the
interaction of the monastic and lay communities is integral to the
way of life set out by the Vinaya.

Many of the rules of the Vinaya concerned with food, for
example, are clearly designed to force members of the Sangha
to be dependent on lay support. That is, if the Vinaya was
intended to regulate the life of a self-sufficient community of
ascetics who had no contact with society at large, it could have
been structured differently. Instead it specifies that a monk
should not handle money;”° he should not eat food that he has
not received from someone else;”! he should not dig the ground
or have it dug, and so is effectively prohibited from farming;”
strictly he should not store food unless sick, and then only for

94 The Buddhist Community

seven days;” finally he is discouraged from cooking.” If called
on. to preach or attend to a lay supporter in various ways, then
the community of monks should provide someone.”> All these
tules have the effect of drawing the Buddhist monk into a
relationship with society, and balancing any tendency towards
becoming a movement of eremitic ascetics.

The lifestyle of the Buddhist monk is thus founded on a rela-
tionship of trust between himself and his supporters. In accept-
ing lay support in the form of robes, food, and lodgings, the monk
enters into a kind of social contract; it becomes his responsib-
ility to live in a certain way, namely to live the holy or spiritual
life (brahmacarya) to the best of his ability. If Buddhism is
unthinkable without the Sangha, then it is also true that the Sangha
is unthinkable without lay support. The texts are thus at pains
to point out that certain kinds of behaviour become inappro-
priate in the light of this contract; to spend one’s time playing
games or at entertainments; to spend one’s time practising
astrology and various kinds of divining. The concern here seems
not so much to condemn these practices as such but merely
to reinforce the principle that as a Buddhist monk one accepts
lay support in order to practise the spiritual life. As a Buddhist
monk one is deserving of lay support to the extent one attempts
to put into practice the teachings of the Buddha, and not because
of one’s skills as an astrologer or doctor. Thus to lie about
one’s spiritual attainments is, as we have seen, undermining of
this relationship of trust. Yet if the responsibility resting on the
shoulders of the Buddhist monk should appear too heavy, the
Buddha is recorded as reassuring them that if one dwells for
even a finger-snap absorbed in meditation on loving kindness,
then one has not eaten the country’s alms food in vain.”¢

Other Vinaya rules are concerned to make sure that a monk
avoids behaviour that might be misconstrued by the laity; his
conduct should be in all respects beyond reproach. Thus talking
in private with a woman or spending the night in the same
house as a woman are prohibited.”” The monk should also avoid
behaviour that might be considered bad manners or give offence
in some other way.

From wandering to settled life: forest dwellers
and town dwellers

The ideal that the lifestyle of the Buddhist monk is founded upon
is that of the homeless wanderer who, having renounced all
possessions and gone forth from the household life, dresses in
robes made from discarded rags, begs for his food, and takes as
his dwelling the forest, a mountain cave, or the foot of a tree.
Perhaps one of the most uncompromising descriptions of the re-
nouncer’s lifestyle is that found in a poem near the beginning of
the Suttanipata. Here the renouncer is advised to wander alone,
free from any ties of family and friendship, ‘like the [single]
horn of the Indian rhinoceros’.* Although Buddhist tradition
has not seen this account as a general prescription for Buddhist
monastic life, there has been a tendency for modern scholarship
to take the kind of picture it presents at face value. The history
of the Sangha in ancient India can then be read as a series of
compromises that amount to a gradual corruption of the ancient
ideal. On this view, the monks at first wandered completely
homeless in their single-minded intent on the goal of nirvana.
Increasing numbers of spiritually inexperienced and immature
monks made it necessary for the Buddha to lay down more rules
and regulations. Step by step this led to the institutionalization
of the Sangha. Particularly significant in this process was a rule
which is said to have been laid down in response to complaints
that Buddhist monks wandering about during the monsoon
rainy season were causing damage to plants and small creatures;
this rule therefore requires monks to take up residence in one
place for the three months of the rains. The consequence of this
was the establishment of residential monasteries and the grad-
ual evolution of a more settled way of life.”

But there are problems with such a model of the evolution of
the Sangha. To begin with, as the more recent work of Mohan
Wijayaratna and Gregory Schopen has shown, the Vinaya texts
as we have them certainly already assume the development of
a settled way of life and the picture of the typical monk’s way
of life reflected in them is not exactly that of the homeless

96 The Buddhist Community

wanderer. Schopen takes this as reason to conclude that the Vinaya
texts as we have them reflect a state of affairs long after the death
of the Buddha and in their present form must belong to a rather
later period than is usually assumed—the early centuries of the
Christian era. And yet, as Steven Collins has pointed out in his
introduction, Wijayaratna’s study of the early Pali sources brings
out the extent to which they contain a coherent, developed, and
well-integrated conception of monastic life, and this suggests that
we must redraw our picture of the Buddhist monk as exclusively
a homeless forest dweller even in the lifetime of the Buddha.
Schopen might respond that in pushing the existence of a settled
monastic way of life too far back in time, we assume too much
development in too short a period of time and deny the Sangha
any history.*° But the fact remains that we are still unclear of
the extent to which the Sangha can be regarded as having a
‘pre-Buddhist’ history. That is, a comparison with Jain monastic
organization indicates that certain rules and principles, includ-
ing the institution of a residential rains, are held in common. This
suggests that either Buddhism and Jainism have borrowed from
each other or that both have drawn on a common heritage. It
may well be the case that the varied ‘renouncer’ tradition from
which both Jainism and Buddhism emerge had already devel-
oped certain institutional patterns by the time of the Buddha,
and that these have been drawn upon and adapted to suit the
characteristically Buddhist vision of a mendicant order.

Again as Gregory Schopen has made clear, if we want to form
some idea of the reality of ancient Buddhism, in addition to the
evidence of ancient texts, we must take into account the archaeo-
logical evidence of ancient inscriptions and other artefacts. Dating
from the third or second centuries BcE, these reflect the reality
of how Buddhism was actually practised less problematically than
the ideals of the texts. Once again the picture that can be drawn
on the basis of these makes it clear that the homeless mendicant
wanderer, meditating in the forest, intent on nirvana, was nei-
ther the only, nor probably the numerically dominant, actuality.

For a general picture of Buddhist monastic life in ancient
India and Sri Lanka through the centuries of the first millennium

The Buddhist Community 97

cE, the most generally useful textual sources, apart from the vari-
ous Vinayas, are the Pali commentaries and the records of three
Chinese Buddhist pilgrims: Fa-hsien, who spent some fifteen
years travelling in northern India and Sri Lanka at the beginning
of the fifth century (399-414), Hsiian-tsang, who travelled through-
out India, in the first half of the seventh century (630-643), and
I-tsing, who visited India and the Malay archipelago towards
the end of the seventh century (671—-695).*! Archaeological and
inscriptional evidence comes from a great variety of monastic sites
across India and from Sri Lanka.

These sources suggest that monks lived as more or less per-
manent residents in monasteries (vihdra, drama) that usually con-
sisted of a number of buildings: residential quarters, a teaching
hall, and a posadha hall (for the fortnightly recitation of the monas-
tic rule). The religious heart of a monastery was threefold: a stiipa
(containing relics, ideally of the Buddha or of some acknowledged
‘saint’), a Bodhi-tree (an asvattha or ficus religiosa—the type of
tree the Buddha gained awakening under—often growing on a
platform), and finally a shrine hall or image house.” All three
would have been the object of considerable devotional practice
by monks and laity alike. Monasteries varied enormously in size.
Fa-hsien records that the Abhayagiri Vihara at Anuradhapura,
the ancient capital of Sri Lanka, housed 5,000 monks, while I-
tsing states that at the famous monastic university of Nalanda in
eastern India there were some 3,000 residents.*> Such monastic
establishments included kitchens, refectories, latrines, bathing
facilities, and libraries. Whether or not the figures of the Chinese
pilgrims are exaggerated, the remains of these ancient monastic
complexes are impressive in themselves and bear witness to
their grand past. Patronized by royalty and the wealthy, many
monasteries had considerable endowments in the form of pro-
perty, lands, and other material goods. Thus in both India and
Sri Lanka we find the development of a system (already adum-
brated in the Vinaya itself) whereby monasteries’ requirements
for food were provided by the produce of land farmed on behalf
of the monastery by laity who received a share in return.* Large
monasteries also employed considerable numbers of lay servants

98 The Buddhist Community

of various sorts in order to handle donations of money and goods
and oversee their running. The canonical Vinaya sources refer
to the office of kappiya-karaka (Sanskrit kalpi-kara), a layman
who makes ‘allowable’ (kappiya) gifts that would otherwise,
according to the strictures of the Vinaya, not be permissible.
This is relevant especially to donations of land and money, which
individual monks and nuns are strictly forbidden from accepting
or handling, but which the kappiya-karaka could receive and
administer on their behalf.** The Sangha could thus become the
effective owner of considerable property, wealth, and resources,
while individual monks also came to exercise rights over pro-
perty which in certain circumstances extended to being able to
leave it to their monastic pupils.*

A situation where a monk lives in a wealthy monastery effect-
ively enjoying personal rights of ownership over a share of that
monastery’s wealth is somewhat removed from the ideal of the
homeless mendicant, wandering from village to village with alms-
bowl and dressed in rag robes retrieved from a dust heap, intent
on his spiritual quest. But we must remember that there were
also monks, perhaps the majority, who lived in more modest small
village monasteries. There were also those, no doubt a small minor-
ity, who continued to be inspired by the ascetic ideal, setting off
for the forest, living in caves, or donning robes made from rags
discarded on rubbish heaps.

In the context of developed Buddhist monasticism, dwell-
ing in the forest or wearing robes made of rags from a dust
heap became two of a set of twelve or thirteen specialized ascetic
practices (dhuta-guna/dhutanga) that an individual monk might
undertake for a shorter or longer period.” These forest-dwelling
(Granyaka/arafinika) or rag robe-wearing (pamsu-/pamsu-kilika)
monks are contrasted with the town-dwelling (gama-vasin) monks.
Although the numbers of forest monks may have been relatively
small, their strict practice meant that they attracted the sup-
port of the laity and that they enjoyed considerable prestige and
influence.** Ironically this meant that they did not always suc-
ceed in maintaining their ascetic practice and that in ancient Sri
Lanka, for example, monks belonging to nominally Arafifiika

The Buddhist Community 99

or Pamsukilika groups did not necessarily dwell in the forest or
wear rag robes. The tendency of the laity to direct their special
gifts and particular devotions towards monks whose lifestyle
approximates most closely to the traditional ascetic ideal at once
invests them with power and threatens to undermine the basis
of that power. Their monastic establishments become the most
prosperous and, as a consequence, their ascetic tradition was most
in danger of being compromised.* Yet the ideal of the wan-
derer intent on the Buddhist monk’s traditional spiritual quest
continued to be seen as embodied in the forest-dwelling or rag
robe-wearing monk, and the periodic attempt to re-establish the
ancient ascetic ideal is one of the defining features of the history
of Buddhist monasticism. But, as the following story illustrates,
it is the spirit of that ancient ideal that inspires the tradition, not
the letter.

Two friends, it seems, were ordained as monks at Thiparama
(one of the monasteries belonging to the Mahavihara) in
Anuradhapura, thé ancient capital of Sri Lanka.*° One went off
to Pacinakhandar@ji, a forest monastery in the east; the other
remained at Thiiparama. Ten years passed by. One day it occurred
to the monk at PacinakhandarAaji that he should invite his old
friend to come and practise at this secluded forest monastery. He
set off for Anuradhapura. There he was welcomed by his former
companion. Over the course of the day the visiting monk was
continually waiting for choice foods and other comforts to be
provided by servants, attendants, and lay supporters. But none
was forthcoming. Instead they wandered through Anuradhapura
and got only a ladleful of gruel. As the two wandered through
the town, the visiting monk enquired whether his friend always
lived in such a frugal manner. When he was told that he did, the
visitor reminded him that Pacinakhandaraji was comfortable
and suggested that they go there. As they passed the gate of the
city the other elder took the road to Pacinakhandar§ji.

‘Why do you take this road?’ asked the visitor.

‘Didn’t you just recommend Pacinakhandaraji?’

‘But don’t you have some extra possessions in this place
where you have lived so long?’

100 The Buddhist Community

“Yes, I have the bed and chair belonging to the Sangha, which
have been put away. There is nothing else.’

‘But I have left my staff, my oil tube, and my sandal bag.’

‘Have you collected so much living here for one day?’

Humbled, the visitor declared, ‘For those such as you every-
where is a forest dwelling.’

A note on the Sangha and the state

Strictly speaking the Sangha is an autonomous organization and
no provision is made within the Vinaya for formal links with the
state or government. But this does not mean that in practice close
links and associations between the Sangha and the state have not
developed. The history of Buddhism in all the regions of the world
where it has taken root, from ancient times down to the present
day, affords numberous examples of such links and associations.

For much of its history the Sangha has existed in countries
tuled by a king or emperor. A king may become a patron of the
Sangha granting it his support. Theoretically he may do this as
an individual lay follower (updsaka), and his individual support
should be possible to distinguish from official state support. In
practice this distinction becomes hard to maintain. For Buddhist
tradition it is the figure of the Indian emperor Asoka who has
become the archetype of a Buddhist king. ASoka reigned c.268-
231 BCE and extended the Mauryan empire across nearly the entire
Indian subcontinent. ASoka’s rock and pillar edicts, which have
been found in various locations throughout India, indicate that
after a particularly bloody military campaign in Kalinga (eastern
India) he turned to Buddhist teachings and came to regard him-
self as a committed lay supporter (updsaka) of the Sangha. His
edicts subsequently go on to self-consciously promote Dharma
throughout his empire and beyond, commending in particular
the non-injury of living creatures, the provision of medical care
for the sick, and tolerance among all religious groups, while at
the same time highlighting his own efforts in these directions.
Although he seems personally to have favoured Buddhism, he
continued to support other religious groups. His edicts are not
so much a bid to convert his subjects to Buddhism as an attempt

The Buddhist Community 101

to put into practice some of its principles in his role as emperor.
Thus while his vision of Dhamma is not couched in narrow and
exclusively Buddhist terms it does appear to owe much to his
personal understanding of Buddhist teaching. Buddhist tradition
claims Asoka as its own and many legends about his life are
recounted in the Asokavadana and the Sinhalese chronicles
(Dipavamsa and Mahavamsa)."

Once a king has become involved in supporting the Sangha,
then the avenues are open not only for state interference in and
control of the affairs of the Sangha, but also for the Sangha to
become involved in the affairs of the state and political intrigue.
The state may seek to justify its actions—including war—in the
name of support for the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha; it may
seek to support the sections of the Sangha that it judges as
representing the true Dharma; the Sangha may connive in this,
with different factions appealing for state support. Thus an anci-
ent Sri Lankan chronicle, the Mahdvamsa, seeks to justify
Dutthagamini’s war against the Tamil king, Elara, as a victory for
Dharma; in medieval Japan rival gangs of Tendai ‘monks’ (some
armed) clashed in the struggle for political influence; in Tibet Sa-
skya Pandita’s meeting with the Mongol Khan in 1249 paved the
way for a ‘patron-priest’ relationship (yon mchod) with political
overtones; in modern times Buddhism has been closely linked
to the legitimation of power in Sri Lanka and South-East Asia.”

The spiritual life: the practice of ‘meritorious action’

The heart of Buddhist spiritual life, whether lay or monastic, is
punya (Pali pufifia). This term is usually translated as ‘merit’ and
refers to certain significant kinds of action that are regarded as
auspicious and potent deeds. Essentially, merit is good ‘karma’
(Karman/kamma): wholesome (kuSala/kusala) deeds which plant
seeds that bear fortunate and pleasant fruits, whether in this life
or lives to come, and thereby create conditions for further mer-
itorious action in the future. These are the kinds of action that
conduce to the development of the qualities of the eightfold path.
Moreover it is making merit that binds the lay and monastic

102 The Buddhist Community

communities together. The traditional ‘bases of merit’ are gen-
erosity (dana), ethical conduct (Sila/sila), and meditation (bhavana).

In its widest sense ‘generosity’ is understood as embracing all
acts performed with a generous and giving spirit, but it also has
a more specific application: it refers especially to the generosity
of the laity in supporting the Sangha materially. This first basis
of merit is thus regarded as of particular concern to the laity. Yet
as the recipients of the laity’s material gifts, members of the Sangha
have a special responsibility, namely to act as the ‘field of merit’
(punya-ksetra/punna-kkhetta) for the gifts of the laity. A monk
is only a fertile and productive field of merit as long as he lives
according to the Vinaya, behaving as a monk should. One of the
principles of Buddhist ethics is that the unwholesome or whole-
some quality of one’s acts is also affected by their object: to kill
a human is a weightier unwholesome act than killing a dog; a gift
to a spiritually accomplished monk is a more powerful whole-
some act than a casual gift to one’s neighbour. Of course, pre-
occupation with a recipient’s worthiness to receive gifts on the
part of the donor is liable to be bound up more with the motiva-
tions of greed and delusion than with generosity and wisdom, and
should thus be avoided as undermining the very act of giving.
The principle is more important for the one who receives a gift
than the donor. Thus the onus is on a monk to make himself a
suitable recipient of the laity’s gifts. So long as a monk lives in
accordance with the basic precepts of the Vinaya, he fulfils his
obligation to society and renders himself a field of merit for the
laity. The more fully a monk lives out the spiritual life, the more
fruitful a field of merit he becomes for the laity’s gifts; thus
the Sangha consisting of the different kinds of ‘noble persons’
(arya-pudgala/ariya-puggala) of stream-attainers, once returners,
never-returners, and arhats—the Buddhist saints—becomes the
‘unsurpassable field of merit’.

The practice of generosity is, however, also relevant to the
Sangha. As I suggested above, in becoming a monk one enters
into a contract with society: in return for material support one
undertakes to live the spiritual life and to give in return the gift
of Dharma.“ As a medieval Sinhalese work advises monks:

The Buddhist Community 103

‘Householders continually provide you with gifts of material
goods, and in return you must provide them with the gift of
Dharma.” To an extent just living the life of a monk is a teach-
ing in itself, a gift of Dharma to society. But the Sangha’s gift of
Dharma is conceived in broader terms.

As a ‘field of merit’ the Sangha is under some obligation
simply to make itself available to the laity. One of the principal
ways in which the Vinaya brings this about is by requiring monks
to receive food from the laity every day. Moreover, the Vinaya
stipulates that the Sangha is normally bound to accept the laity’s
invitations, especially when a building or land is being offered
to the Sangha, or when a lay follower has built a new house, gets
married, or dies. In such circumstances the Sangha should send
some representative. A monk’s presence on such occasions has
the effect of rendering them auspicious; they become opportun-
ities for acts of merit. In the first place a monk can be offered
food and simply act as a field of merit, but they became, and in
the countries of Theravada Buddhism continue to be, primary
occasions for members of the Sangha to offer the gift of Dharma
to the laity by preaching the Dharma directly to them and
chanting ‘blessings of protection’ (raksd@/paritta) to ward off the
dangers of accident and disease (see pp. 168-9). It should be noted
in this context, however, that the Buddhist monk does not tra-
ditionally act as a ‘priest’ on these occasions: marriages and
funerals do not involve rituals or ‘sacraments’ that require the
participation of an ordained member of the Sangha to consecrate
them. Again blessings chanted by the laity are still effective,
although, in line with the kind of thinking outlined above, those
chanted by a group of spiritually accomplished monks are likely
to be considered more auspicious and potent.

For a member of the Sangha, the basis of merit that consists
in ethical conduct centres on his following the prescriptions
of the Vinaya, and this I have already discussed. What of the
Sangha’s practice of ‘meditation’? In the ancient period it is
tempting to associate serious devotion to the practice of medita-
tion with the forest-dwelling tradition, but not all ‘forest-dwellers’
lived in the remote jungle, and (as our story illustrated) it is not

104 The Buddhist Community

necessarily the case that the life of monks in the larger well-
endowed city monasteries was lax or especially comfortable;
some of these monasteries kept up a strict regime of spiritual prac-
tice.” Moreover all monks would have participated alongside
the laity in the various devotional practices which are associated
with the ‘recollections’ (anusmrti/anussati) (see p. 179) and which
are intended to arouse and cultivate religious emotions that are
an aspect of ‘calm’ (Samatha) meditation. Essentially such de-
votional practices take the form of worship (piija) by means of
prostrations, circumambulation, and making offerings of flowers,
incense, and lamps to ‘relics’ (dhatu) of the Buddha. These may
be of three kinds: actual physical remains of the body of the Buddha
(or some other Buddhist saint); articles ‘used’ by the Buddha,
such as his bowl or the Bodhi-tree; and ‘reminders’, such as images
of the Buddha.** Worship of the first two types of relic centred
principally around the veneration of the stiipas enshrining such
relics—though images too might enshrine relics—and of the
Bodhi-trees normally found in each monastery.

In addition to this kind of worship, monks also seem to have
participated in other activities along with the laity, commission-
ing and even sometimes making images of the Buddha, and
other Buddhist monuments. The making of works of art was an
act of merit, and the ancient inscriptions record that often the
merit from such acts was dedicated or ‘transferred’ to parents or
even to the benefit of all sentient beings.”

In Chapter 2 I drew attention to a distinction made in later Pali
sources between two main duties: the ‘task of spiritual insight’
(vipassana-dhura) and the scholarly ‘task of books’ (gantha-dhura).®
This distinction indicates that as well as having the responsibility
of putting the teaching into practice by keeping the Vinaya and
cultivating meditation, the Sangha has also traditionally been
responsible for the preservation and study of the scriptures. Some
Buddhist monasteries have thus also been great centres of learn-
ing and scholarship, which has taken in not only the study of
Buddhist and other systems of philosophical and religious thought,
but also the study of such disciplines as medicine, grammar, liter-
ature, astronomy, and astrology.*' This distinction between the

The Buddhist Community 105

vocations of practice and scholarship corresponds in part with
that between forest-dwelling and town-dwelling. But these two
vocations should not be seen as mutually exclusive in that an
individual monk might in the course of his monastic career at
one time spend a period meditating in the forest and at another
devote himself to scholarship in a large monastery.

While the very success of the Sangha may have in certain re-
spects compromised the original ascetic ideal of the Buddhist
monk, it would be a mistake to conclude that it extinguished
it. The ascetic ideal remained alive and not only continued to
inspire the life of the Sangha, but continued to be realized. Of
course the grand monasteries of the ‘city-dwelling’ (grama-vasin)
monks patronised by royalty and the wealthy will inevitably leave
more substantial remains than the abodes of ‘forest-dwelling’
(Granya-vasin) monks; the literary activities of scholar (gantha-
dhura) monks leave material evidence in the form of manuals
and treatises; monks who commission statues or stiipas and
dedicate the merit to their deceased parents leave behind inscrip-
tions. But the signs left by anonymous monks following the path
of meditation (vipassana-dhura) in the forest are harder to trace
and follow. This makes problematic Schopen’s assertion that the
literary and archaeological evidence forces us to the conclusion
that the ascetic ideal of the forest monk became early in the
history of Buddhist monasticism merely ‘a dead letter’.** The
history of Buddhist monasticism can be seen in the light of a
continued interplay, and sometimes tension, between the town-
dwelling monks and the forest monks, between the scholar
monks and the practitioners. Although the former may have been
numerically more significant, the ideal of the forest saint has
continued to exercise a considerable power over the imaginations
of both the Sangha and the laity down to the present day, with
the consequence that there have always been significant attempts
to put that ideal into practice.

T have been talking in broad terms and of the past. What of the
present actuality? The various studies that have been made of
Theravada Buddhist practice in Sri Lanka and the countries

106 The Buddhist Community

of South-East Asia suggest that the general pattern of monastic
practice and its organization are not entirely dissimilar from the
historical pattern. Indeed, one of the significant conclusions of
Richard Gombrich’s important study of traditional Buddhism
in the rural highlands of Sri Lanka in the 1960s was that things
appeared to have changed rather little over the previous fifteen
hundred years (although the significance of modernist tenden-
cies among the urban middle classes of Colombo and Bangkok
should not be underestimated).* It is dangerous to generalize
about the reality of Buddhist monasticism in such diverse set-
tings as Sri Lanka, Cambodia, China, Japan, and Tibet. There
are, nevertheless, features of the practice of Buddhist monastic-
ism in these different settings that amount to a certain continuity
of tradition, and suggest that the picture that can be drawn on
the basis of the ancient sources is not merely of archaeological
and antiquarian interest. Moreover, the basic pattern is similar.
What we tend to find throughout Buddhist history and through-
out the Buddhist world are a number of grand, important and
wealthy monasteries (especially in capital cities and large urban
centres), many more smaller local village monasteries, together
with a small but always significant group of monks following a
more secluded way of life in the forest, in caves, or in more
isolated monasteries. Individual monks may gravitate towards
one kind of lifestyle or another, but the tendency to view Bud-
dhist monastic practice in terms of a stark polarization between
the meditating forest monk and the town-dwelling scholar
monk should be tempered with the reminder that these are ideal
abstractions. In the course of a monastic career in all Buddhist
traditions monks are likely to move between monasteries and
ways of life.%°

While this pattern remains generally relevant one should
bear in mind that Buddhist monastic practice has developed
characteristic features in various places at various times. Strict
adherence to the letter of the Vinaya have been affected both by
individual temperaments and local circumstances. For example,
everywhere today there is certain laxity with regard to the rule
prohibiting the handling of money, although some Theravadin

The Buddhist Community 107

forest monks will strictly adhere to it; the practice of not eating
solid food after midday is more strictly followed in Theravada
monasticism than in East Asian and Tibetan;** among the Ch’an
monks of China it became the norm for monks to farm and grow
their own food in accordance with the additional code of Pai-
chang and Ta-chih Huai-hai (720-814), laying down that monks
should perform some productive labour every day;°’ the alms
round, which remains common in South-East Asia but rarer in
Sri Lanka, became very rare in China where, however, begging
for money has been more common;* Chinese monasticism in-
volves a more definite tradition of physical austerities (such as
the burning of incense cones on one’s head at ordination); in the
context of Japanese Pure Land tradition we find the transforma-
tion of the monastic Sangha into what is effectively a married
priesthood, while following the Meiji Restoration of 1868 the
Japanese government decreed that monks should marry; in cer-
tain schools of Tibetan Buddhism a tradition of lay teachers and
practitioners has become more developed and formalized.

So while it is possible to read the history of the Buddhist Sangha
as the process of the gradual compromising of its ascetic ideal,
it is also possible that we should see the compromise as inher-
ent in the characteristically Buddhist vision of the life of the
homeless wanderer. That is, the tendency to leave society is
deliberately balanced in the Vinaya by rules which force the monk
back into a relationship with society. The dynamic of the Buddhist
monastic way of life is then to be seen as rooted in the inter-
action between a more settled monastic lifestyle and the ideal
of the forest-dwelling wanderer.

The lay community

As I have already indicated, the support of a lay community
is essential to the existence of the Buddhist Sangha and thus
to Buddhism. The Buddhist lay community is traditionally said
to comprise the two ‘assemblies’ of male (updsaka) and female
lay disciples (updsika). An upaésaka/upasika is one who formally
declares that he or she goes to the Buddha, the Dharma, and

108 The Buddhist Community

Sangha as refuge, and we can see this act as loosely defining an
individual as a ‘Buddhist’. In ancient India the Buddhist Sangha
probably received considerable support from ‘householders’
who would not have regarded themselves as formally Buddhist
upasakas or upasikas, moreover becoming even an updsaka or
upasika did not necessarily involve an exclusive commitment to
the Buddhist Sangha.” Some householders seem to have supported
wanderers of various groups—Jains, Ajivikas, Buddhists—rather
indiscriminately, with little awareness of their different teachings,
seeing them all as ‘holy men’ and as such deserving of some
support. Other householders and their families clearly developed
a sense of loyalty and commitment to one particular group or
teacher, seeking out their company and requesting them to
teach. But even this need not have involved exclusive allegiance.
Thus we are told that when a supporter of the Jain order took
refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha, the Buddha sug-
gested that he should honour the traditions of his family and not
withdraw all support from the Jains.” Historically the degree of
commitment and support offered to the Sangha, the degree of
interest taken in Buddhist teachings and practice by lay supporters
must have varied a great deal. Much the same state of affairs
prevails in Buddhist cultures today. Thus in Theravada practice
today the term updsaka or upasika implies a commitment to
and involvement with Buddhist practice beyond what is implied
by the routine taking of the refuges; in East Asian and Tibetan
Buddhism formally ‘going for refuge’ often becomes an expres-
sion of a particular commitment to Buddhist practice.

As we saw at the close of Chapter 3, the Buddhist path can be
summed up in terms of the progressive development of generosity
(dana), good conduct (sila/sila), and meditation (bhdvanda). The
very act of giving is seen in general as loosening attachment, turn-
ing the mind away from selfish concerns. From the point of view
of Buddhist psychological theory, generosity is an expression of
two of the wholesome ‘roots’ or fundamental motivating forces of
the mind: non-attachment and friendliness. Many of the stories
of the Buddha’s previous lives (jdtaka) tell of the Bodhisattva’s
heroic acts of generosity. One of the most famous relates how

The Buddhist Community 109

he offered his flesh to a hungry tigress in order that she might
have the strength to succour her young.” Another well-known
tale tells of Prince Vessantara, who gave away even that which
is most precious: his children and family. Such heroic acts
of generosity are expressions of a bodhisattva’s practice of ‘the
perfection of generosity’, inspiring faith rather than providing
examples of behaviour to be emulated. In everyday practice,
generosity is developed by the laity especially by acts of generosity
directed towards the Buddhist religion itself. This takes the form
of supporting Dharma by donating money, time, and effort for
the building of monasteries and temples, and for the general
support of the Buddhist monastic community, for the copying or
publication of Buddhist writings. In the countries of Theravada
Buddhism the term dana refers in particular to the act of giving
alms directly to Buddhist monks either by offering food at a
monastery or by placing it directly into the bowls of monks who
still undertake a traditional alms round.

Relevant to the cultivation of generosity are two practices
which are not, however, exclusively lay: the transference of
merit and the rejoicing in the merit of others. The practice of the
transference of merit—the giving of one’s merit—is an ancient
and extremely widespread and common Buddhist practice. What
it indicates is that spiritual practice is to be entered into in a
generous spirit, not for the sake of acquiring merit exclusively
for oneself but for the benefit of others too. Indeed, only acts
undertaken in this spirit are truly meritorious in the first place.
The rejoicing in the merit of others also indicates that, in under-
taking meritorious acts, it is one’s state of mind that is crucial:
thus if one gives grudgingly, with an ungenerous heart, the aus-
piciousness of one’s acts is compromised; on the other hand, if
one gives nothing at all but is deeply moved by another’s act of
generosity, then that in itself is an auspicious occasion, an act of
merit. Thus for many Buddhists it is customary at the end of Bud-
dhist devotions and rituals to offer the merit generated during
the ceremony for the benefit of other beings—either specific beings
such as dead relatives, or all sentient beings—and in so doing to
invite all present (whether they have directly participated in the

110 The Buddhist Community

ceremony or not, whether they have physical presence or are un-
seen ghosts or gods) also to rejoice in the merit of the ceremony.

The practice of good conduct takes the form of commitment
to the five precepts usually recited in conjunction with the three
refuges: (1) to refrain from harming living creatures, (2) to
refrain from taking what is not given, (3) to refrain from sexual
misconduct, (4) to refrain from false speech, (5) to refrain from
intoxicants that cause heedlessness (see pp. 170-2). In addition
the lay disciple may on special occasions (traditionally the full
moon ‘observance’ days) or for longer periods take the eight
precepts, replacing the third precept (refraining from sexual
misconduct) with complete sexual abstinence and adding (6)
refraining from eating after midday, (7) refraining from attend-
ing entertainments and using perfumes, etc., and (8) refraining
from using luxurious beds. In taking the eight precepts the lay
follower takes on a discipline that approximates to the ten pre-
cepts of novice members of the Sangha.

As far as the lay cultivation of meditation is concerned, prac-
tice can be seen as centring around the various kinds of offerings
(piija) which arouse the religious emotion of faith (Sraddha/saddha)
and conduce to the development of the initial stages of calm
meditation (see p. 179). Pilgrimages to the sites associated with
the events of the Buddha’s life and also to local holy places and
shrines are another significant feature of lay Buddhist practice,
as too are festivals of various sorts. These again fit into the gen-
eral pattern of arousing religious emotion. The fact that Buddhist
devotions centred on stiipas, Bodhi-trees and images of the Bud-
dha, the finest and most sacred of which were generally to be
found in the grounds of monasteries, meant that monasteries were
also centres of lay religious activity.

Spiro's schema: apotropaic, kammatic, and
nibbanic Buddhism

In an important anthropological study of post-war Burmese Bud-
dhist practice, Melford Spiro proposed a distinction between three
forms of Buddhism: ‘apotropaic’, ‘kammatic’, and ‘nibbanic’.
By the first he meant Buddhist activity that is concerned with

The Buddhist Community III

day-to-day ‘protection’ of a community and individual and im-
proving conditions in the here and now. By the second he meant
Buddhist practice that is concerned with acquiring ‘merit’ and
producing a better rebirth. By the third he meant Buddhist prac-
tice that aims directly at the attainment of nirvana (Pali nibbana)
and release from the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth that is
samsara. The first Spiro regards as basically using ‘magical’ means
such as chants, amulets, and so forth; the second involves the
traditional practice of generosity and ethical conduct; the third
the practice of meditation. While based on his observation
of Burmese Buddhism, such a schema can, with certain quali-
fications, be seen as more generally relevant. As a number of
writers have pointed out, Spiro, although recognizing that these
three complexes are not entirely distinct, nevertheless has a tend-
ency to present them as such. Moreover, he also tends to see their
goals as incompatible and even contradictory; only the goal of
nirvana represents a truly Buddhist goal, while apotropaic and
kammatic Buddhist practice represent a corruption and com-
promise respectively of the true and original ideal of Buddhism.
Yet, as we shall see, the use of protective chants is certainly ancient
(see p. 168) and the appeal to powerful beings for short-term help
and protection is not necessarily in conflict with the principles of
Buddhism; what is, is the notion that an all-powerful being might
bring one ultimate salvation. Equally the association of the prac-
tice of meditation with certain extraordinary ‘magical’ powers is
normative in the ancient texts (pp. 185-6); their practice is not
generally condemned, only their display by monks for money or
to win converts. Moreover, the practice of at least some of what
Spiro identifies as ‘apotropaic’ Buddhism can be seen as part of
creating an environment of protection conducive to the practice
of calm meditation. Again, as we shall see (p. 179), there is no
sharp divide between certain merit making activities of pija and
certain of the traditional subjects of calm meditation. Finally one
should avoid the conclusion that what Spiro calls apotropaic and
kammatic Buddhism are the strict preserve of the layman and
nibbanic Buddhism the preserve of the monk. In practice many,
perhaps most, monks are equally concerned with apotropaic and
kammatic Buddhism and a few lay followers with nibbanic.

The Buddhist Cosmos
The Thrice-Thousandfold World

Of space and time: world-systems

In Chapter 3 we saw how the Buddha’s teaching seeks to address
the problem of duhkha or ‘suffering’. For Buddhist thought,
whatever the circumstances and conditions of existence—good
or bad—they are always ultimately changeable and unreliable,
and hence duhkha. Complete understanding of the first noble truth
is said to consist in the complete knowledge of the nature of
duhkha. One of the preoccupations of Buddhist theory, then, is
the exhaustive analysis of all possible conditions and circumstances
of existence. Buddhist thought approaches the analysis of duhkha
from two different angles, one cosmological and the other psy-
chological. That is, it asks two different but, in the Buddhist
view of things, fundamentally related questions. First, what are
the possible circumstances a being can be born, exist, and die in?
And second, what are the possible states of mind a being might
experience? The complete Buddhist answer to these questions
is classically expressed in the Abhidharma systems. In this chap-
ter I want to look primarily at the first question, though, as I have
just suggested, this cannot be entirely separated from the sec-
ond. To begin with, however, I shall return to certain of those
questions raised by the monk Malunkyaputta.

As we have seen, among the questions he demanded that the
Buddha answer were whether or not the universe was eternal,
and whether or not it was finite. The Buddha refused to give cat-
egorical answers, but that does not mean that he had nothing to
say on the subjects raised by these questions. I have already intro-
duced the bare concept of samsara or the round of rebirth. But
when did it all begin? How long, according to Buddhist thinking

The Buddhist Cosmos 113

on the matter, have you and I together with other beings been
wandering from birth to death through samsara?

In response to just this question the Buddha is said to have
declared that samsara’s beginning was inconceivable and that its
starting point could not be indicated; he went on to ask the group
of monks he was addressing which they thought was greater, the
mother’s milk they had drunk in the course of their long jour-
ney through samsara or the water in the four great oceans. ‘Cer-
tainly the mother’s milk drunk by you is greater,’ they were told.!
We have, it seems, been wandering in samsara for aeons. But
how long is an aeon? When asked this question, the Buddha
refused to answer in terms of numbers of years, or hundreds or
even thousands of years; instead he gave a simile:

Suppose there was a great mountain of rock, seven miles across and seven
miles high, a solid mass without any cracks. At the end of every hun-
dred years a man might brush it just once with a fine Benares cloth.
That great mountain of rock would decay and come to an end sooner
than ever the aeon. So long is an aeon. And of aeons of this length not
just one has passed, not just a hundred, not just a thousand, not just a
hundred thousand.”

If this is how the age of the universe is to be conceived,
what of its spatial extent? On another occasion the Buddha told
a householder, Kevaddha, of a monk who wished to discover just
where the four elements of earth, water, fire, and wind ceased
completely.* We can understand this as wishing to discover the
limits of the physical universe. The monk was a master of medi-
tation (samadhi) and so was able to attain a state of concentra-
tion in which he was able to visit the realms of various devas or
‘gods’ and put his question to them. First he approached the gods
of the Four Kings; they were unable to answer his question but
directed him to yet higher gods who in turn passed him on to
still higher gods: the gods of the Thirty-Three, the Yama gods,
the Contented gods, the gods who Delight in Creation, the Mas-
ters of the Creations of Others, the gods of Brahma. None could
answer his question. Finally he approached Great Brahma him-
self, who repeatedly answered only that he was Great Brahma,

114 The Buddhist Cosmos

‘mighty, unconquerable, all-seeing, master, lord, maker, creator,
overseer, controller, father of all who are and will be’. In the face
of the monk’s persistence, Great Brahma eventually took him
aside and confessed that he too did not know where the elements
cease and suggested that the monk return to the Buddha and put
the question to him. The Buddha’s answer, we are told, was that
where the four elements cease completely is in the conscious-
ness that knows nirvana.*

This story from the Kevaddha Sutta (‘Discourse to Kevaddha’)
indicates how in the traditional Buddhist view of things the uni-
verse is not to be thought of as just inhabited by the beings that
make up the human and animal world but also by various classes
of deva or ‘god’ that form a hierarchy of increasing subtlety and
refinement. Thus the world comprises ‘its gods, its Mara and
Brahma, this generation with its ascetics and brahmins, with its
princes and peoples’.* Moreover, elsewhere, the earliest texts
inform us that there is not just one such world with its gods, its
Mara and Brahma; in fact the universe as a whole comprises
vast numbers of ‘world-spheres’ or ‘world-systems’ (cakra-vada/
cakka-vala) each with its gods, its Mara and Brahma. Clusters
of a thousand ‘world-spheres’ may be ruled over by yet higher
gods, called Great Brahmas, but it would be.wrong to conclude
that there is any one or final overarching Great Brahma—God
the Creator. It may be that beings come to take a particular
Great Brahmi as creator of the world, and a Great Brahma may
himself even form the idea that he is creator, but this is just the
result of delusion on the part of both parties. In fact the universe
recedes ever upwards with one class of Great Brahma being
surpassed by a further, higher class of Great Brahma.®

So how many world-systems are there in all? The early Nikaya/
Agama texts sometimes talk in terms of ‘the thousandfold world-
system’, ‘the twice-thousandfold world-system’, and ‘the thrice-
thousandfold world-system’. According to Vasubandhu, the last
of these embraces a total of 1,000,000,000 world-systems, accord-
ing to Buddhaghosa, 1,000,000,000,000.’ But even such a vast
number cannot define the full extent of the universe; it is merely
the highest explicit number of world-systems reported in the
tradition. There is no spatial limit to the extent of world-systems:

The Buddhist Cosmos 115

Buddhaghosa tells us in the Atthasdlini (‘Providing the Mean-
ing’) that if four Great Brahmas from the realm of the Supreme
Gods were to set off in the four directions at a speed which allowed
them to traverse a hundred thousand world-systems in the time
it takes a swift arrow to pass over the shadow of a palm tree,
they would reach nirvana without ever finding the limit of world-
systems.* Great Brahmas of the realm of the Supreme Gods are
beings in their last existence who are certain of reaching final
nirvana at the end of their lives, which last 16,000 aeons. Bearing
in mind the simile for the length of an aeon, I leave it to the reader
to ponder how many hundreds of thousands of world-systems
these Great Brahmas might traverse in 16,000 aeons.

The earliest strata of Buddhist writings, the Nikayas/Agamas,
do not provide a systematic account of the Buddhist under-
standing of the nature of the cosmos, but they do contain many
details and principles that are systematized into a coherent
whole by the Abhidharma traditions of Buddhist thought. Two
great Abhidharma traditions have come down to us, that of
the Theravadins, which has shaped the outlook of Buddhism in
Sri Lanka and South-East Asia, and that of the Sarvastivadins,
whose perspective on many points has passed into Chinese and
Tibetan Buddhism. The elaborate cosmological systems detailed
in these two Abhidharmas are, however, substantially the same,
differing only occasionally on minor points of detail. This elab-
orate and detailed cosmology is thus to be regarded as form-
ing an important and significant part of the common Buddhist
heritage. Moreover, it is not to be regarded as only of quaint
and historical interest; the world-view contained in this traditional
cosmology still exerts considerable influence over the outlook
of ordinary Buddhists in traditional Buddhist societies. In the
one or two instances in what follows where the Sarvastivadin and
Theravadin traditions differ, I have, as a matter of convenience,
presented what is handed down in the Theravadin texts.

According to the developed cosmology of the Abhidharma,
samsara embraces thirty-one levels or realms of existence—that
is, there are thirty-one basic classes of beings comprising the round
of rebirth, and any being may be born at any one of these levels
(see Table 2). Indeed, one should rather say that every being has

118 The Buddhist Cosmos

during the course of his or her wandering through samsara at
some time or another been born in every one of these conditions
apart, that is, from five realms known as ‘the Pure Abodes’; beings
born in these realms, such as the Great Brahmas of the realm of
the Supreme Gods just mentioned, have reached a condition in
which they inevitably attain nirvana and so escape the round of
rebirth. The most basic division of the thirty-one realms is three-
fold. First there is the world of the five senses (kama-dhdatu,
-loka), which comprises eleven realms ranging from the realms
of hell and ‘the hungry ghosts’, through the realms of animals,
jealous gods, and human beings, to the six realms of the lower
gods; the common characteristic of beings in all these realms is
that they are all endowed with consciousness and five physical
senses. Above this there is ‘the world of pure form’ (ripa-dhatu,
-loka) which consists of sixteen realms (the highest of which
are the Pure Abodes just mentioned) occupied by various higher
gods collectively known as Brahmas; these refined beings have
consciousness but only two senses—sight and hearing. Finally there
are the four realms of ‘the formless world’ (ariipa-dhatu, -loka)
occupied by a further class of Brahmas who have only con-
sciousness. These thirty-one realms, from bottom to top, thus reflect
a basic movement from gross to subtle.

It is the lower levels of the universe, that is the world of the
five senses, that arrange themselves into the various distinct
‘world-spheres’ or cakra-vadas. At the centre of a cakra-vada
is the great world mountain, Meru or Sineru. This is surrounded
by seven concentric rings of mountains and seas. Beyond these
mountains, in the four cardinal directions, are four continents.
The southern continent, Jambudvipa or ‘the continent of the rose-
apple tree’, is the continent inhabited by ordinary human beings;
the southern part, below the towering abode of snows (himdlaya)
is effectively India, the land where buddhas arise. In the spaces
between world-spheres and below are various hells, while in the
shadow of the slopes of Mount Meru dwell the jealous gods called
Asuras, expelled from the heaven of the Thirty-Three by its king
Sakra (Pali Sakka). On the slopes of Mount Meru itself and
rising above its peak are the six realms inhabited by the gods of

The Buddhist Cosmos 119

the sense-sphere. A Great Brahma of the lower realms of pure
form may rule over a thousand such world-spheres, while Brahmas
of the higher realms of the form-sphere are said to rule over a
hundred thousand.

What determines in which realm a being is born? The short
answer is karma (Pali kamma): a being’s intentional ‘actions’
of body, speech, and mind—whatever is done, said, or even just
thought with definite intention or volition. In general, though with
some qualification, rebirth in the lower realms is considered to
be the result of relatively unwholesome (akuSala/akusala), or
bad (papa) karma, while rebirth in the higher realms the result
of relatively wholesome (kuSala/kusala), or good (punya/pufifia)
karma. Correspondingly, the lower the realm, the more unpleas-
ant and unhappy one’s condition; the higher the realm the more
pleasant, happy, and refined one’s condition. One should note,
however, that this hierarchy does not constitute a simple ladder
which one, as it were, climbs, passing out at the top into nirvana.
In fact, nirvana may be obtained from any of the realms from
the human to the highest-of the Pure Abodes and the four form-
less realms, but not from the four lowest realms. Yet, rather than
attaining nirvana, beings generally rise and fall, and fall and rise
through the various realms, now experiencing unhappiness, now
experiencing happiness. This precisely is the nature of samsara:
wandering from life to life with no particular direction or purpose.

Cosmology and psychology: macrocosm and microcosm

It is easy to conclude that the detailed enumeration of realms is
the result of an overactive scholastic imagination and is thus of
no practical interest, but to begin to understand the system we
must turn to the subtle and exact psychological insights of the
Abhidharma understanding of consciousness and the processes
governing its occurrence.

The key to understanding the Buddhist cosmological scheme
lies in the principle of the equivalence of cosmology and psychology.
I mean by this that in the traditional understanding the various
realms of existence relate rather closely to certain commonly (and

120 The Buddhist Cosmos

not so commonly) experienced states of mind. In fact Buddhist
cosmology is at once a map of different realms of existence and
a description of all possible experiences. This can be appreciated
by considering more fully the Buddhist understanding of the nature
of karma. At root karma or ‘action’ is considered a mental act
or intention; it is an aspect of our mental life: ‘It is “intention”
that I call karma; having formed the intention, one performs acts
(Karma) by body, speech and mind.” Thus acts of body and speech
are driven by an underlying intention or will (cetand) and they
are unwholesome or wholesome because they are motivated
by unwholesome or wholesome intentions. Acts of body and speech
are, then, the end products of particular kinds of mentality. At
the same time karma can exist as a simple ‘act of will’, a force-
ful mental intention or volition that does not lead to an act of
body or speech.

The nature of bad action is usually illustrated by reference to
a list of the ten courses of unwholesome action (karma/kamma-
patha) which consist of three bodily courses of action (taking life,
taking what is not given, sexual misconduct), four vocal courses
of action (lying, divisive speech, hurtful speech, frivolous speech),
and three mental courses of action (covetousness, ill-will, wrong
view).!°

In the commentarial literature the notion of a course of action
is explained with reference to an action’s being performed with
full intention and full awareness of what one is doing. Thus in
order for the unwholesome course of action of killing to have
occurred, five conditions must have been fulfilled: there must be
a living creature, one must know the creature is living, one must
intend to kill the creature, one must perform the necessary action,
and finally the creature must actually die.'' The nature of good
action is similarly summed up in terms of the ten courses of whole-
some action which consist in refraining from the seven courses
of unwholesome bodily and vocal action and, for the mental courses
of action, desirelessness, kindness, and right view.

Essentially the psychological states that motivate the ten un-
wholesome courses of action—strong greed, hatred, and delusion
—lead to rebirth in the unhappy destinies or ‘descents’: in a hell

The Buddhist Cosmos 121

realm, as a hungry ghost, an animal, or a jealous god. In fact
rather a precise correlation exists here: dominated by greed one
becomes a hungry ghost, a class of beings ever discontent and
anguished because of being unable to satisfy their greed; domin-
ated by hatred one enters one of the hell realms where one
suffers terrible pain; dominated by ignorance one becomes an
animal ruled by the instincts of food and reproduction.” On
the other hand the psychological states that give rise to the ten
wholesome courses of action—desirelessness, friendliness, and
wisdom—lead to rebirth in the happy realms: as a human being
or in one of the six realms of the gods immediately above the
human realm where beings enjoy increasingly happy and care-
free lives. Wholesome action can also be characterized by way
of the triad of terms that are often used to sum up the practice
of the Buddhist path: generosity (dana), ethical conduct (sila/sila),
and meditation (bhavana). The first two essentially embrace con-
duct already covered by the ten wholesome courses of action;
the third term takes us into rather different territory and refers
to the cultivation of various spiritual exercises of contemplation
and meditation in order to develop states of deep peace and con-
centration (Samatha/samatha, samadhi, dhyana/jhana) and insight
and wisdom (vipasyana/vipassand, prajna/panna). As result of
attaining these states to different degrees one is reborn as a Brahma
in one of the realms of pure form; essentially such beings are thus
conceived of as existing absorbed in states of meditation."

In their analysis of consciousness into a hierarchy of various
classes the Abhidharma systematizations further bring out the
way in which cosmology is essentially a reflection of psychology and
vice versa. The basic structure of this hierarchy of conscious-
ness parallels quite explicitly the basic structure of the cosmos.
Irrespective of which cosmological realm a being inhabits, its state
of mind might, at different times, be classified as belonging either
to the sense-sphere (kamdavacara), the form-sphere (riipdavacara),
or the formless-sphere (ariipdavacara), corresponding to the way
in which beings exist either in the sense-world (kama-loka), the
form world (riipa-loka), or formless world (ariipa-loka). More-
over, in detailing the types of consciousness or states of mind

122 The Buddhist Cosmos

that beings reborn in the various realms are able to experience
(or have access to), the Abhidharma provides a further indica-
tion of the parallelism between the psychological order and the
cosmological order.'* Beings in the lowest realms (hell, animal,
hungry ghosts, Asuras) can only experience sense-sphere con-
sciousness; beings in the human realm and the heavens of the
sense-sphere characteristically experience sense-sphere conscious-
ness but can in special circumstances (i.e. when attaining dhyana)
experience form and formless-sphere consciousness; the basis of
existence in the form and formless worlds is form and formless-
sphere consciousness respectively, but the beings born there also
experience certain forms of both wholesome and unwholesome
sense-sphere consciousness, but not those associated with hatred
and unpleasant feeling. The logic governing this arrangement is
as follows. A being in one of the lower realms must experience
at least a modicum of wholesome consciousness, for otherwise
he or she would be stuck there forever, never able to generate
the wholesome karma necessary to bring about rebirth in a
higher realm. Similarly beings in the Brahma worlds must expe-
rience some unwholesome consciousness, otherwise they would
be for ever reborn in these blissful realms where no unpleasant
bodily or mental feeling ever occurs, escaping duhkha perma-
nently rather than only temporarily (albeit for an aeon or two).
Finally, beings such as humans who are in the middle are evenly
poised; they may experience the most unwholesome kinds of con-
sciousness or they may experience the most wholesome—they
may go right to the bottom or right to the top.

Thus in sum one can say that Buddhist cosmology takes the
form of a hierarchy of certain realms of existence related to cer-
tain kinds of mentality. The dynamics of the system viewed from
the perspective of the human realm might be stated along the
following lines. When a human being experiences unpleasant
mental states, such as aversion, hatred, or depression, then there
is a sense in which that being can be said to be experiencing some-
thing of what it is like to exist in a hell realm—in other words,
he makes a brief visit to the hell realms; when those unpleasant
states pass (as they inevitably will), the being will return to the

The Buddhist Cosmos 123

mental state natural to human beings—a mental state which is
understood to be essentially wholesome and pleasant. But if
those states of aversion, hatred, and depression become the
habitual states of mind for that being, the danger is that he will
end up visiting the hell realms for rather longer than he might
have envisaged—in other words, when the wholesome conditions
that placed him in the human realm are exhausted and he dies,
he might find himself not just visiting hell but being reborn there.
Similarly, if a human being should have a somewhat intense
experience of such happy states of mind as friendliness and
generosity, then that is to experience briefly how it feels to be
a deva in one of the various heaven realms immediately above
the human realm; once more, if those states of mind become
habitual and second nature to that being, he is likely to be
reborn among those devas. If a being experiences the even more
subtle and refined states of mind associated with the various
levels of meditation—the so-called dhyanas—he temporarily visits
the Brahma worlds; if he becomes a master of dhyana, he can be
reborn as a Brahma.

Such is a world-system, but world-systems are not static; they
themselves go through vast cycles of expansion and contrac-
tion across the vast aeons of time. According to the Abhidharma
and commentarial traditions of both the Theravadins and
Sarvastivadins, world-systems contract in great clusters (Bud-
dhaghosa in his Visuddhimagga speaks of a billion world-systems
contracting at a time); and when they contract, they contract
from the bottom upwards, the lower realms of world-systems
disappearing first.'* An ancient passage introduces this process
of expansion and contraction as follows:

Now there comes a time when after a long period of time this world
contracts. When the world contracts beings are for the most part born
in the realm of Radiance. There they exist made of mind, feeding on
joy, self-luminous, moving through the air, constantly beautiful; thus they
remain for a long, long time.'®

According to both traditions the passage quoted, referring as it
does to the rebirth of beings in the realm of Radiance (a realm

124 The Buddhist Cosmos

corresponding in the psychological hierarchy to the level of the
second dhyana) at the time of world-contraction, describes this
contraction as the result of destruction by fire. This fire starts in
the lower realms of the sense-sphere and, having burnt up these,
it invades the form realms; but, having burnt up the realms cor-
responding to the first dhyana, it stops. The realms corresponding
to the second, third, and fourth dhydnas and the four formless
realms are thus spared the destruction. But destruction by fire
is not the only kind of destruction, merely the most frequent—
water and wind also wreak their havoc. When the destruction is
by water, the three realms corresponding to the second dhydna
are included in the general destruction. The destruction by wind
invades and destroys even the realms corresponding to the third
dhyana. Only the seven realms corresponding to the fourth
dhyana and the four formless realms are never subject to this
universal destruction.

What becomes of the beings that occupy the lower realms when
fire, water, and wind wreak their destruction? They cannot just
disappear from the round of rebirth, for the only way to achieve
that is to gain awakening as buddhas and arhats do. So these beings
must go somewhere. Opinions differ as to what precisely hap-
pens to them. Some say that all the beings occupying the lower
realms should be understood as being reborn in those higher
Brahma worlds that escape the destruction—this is true even of
the beings in the lowest hell realms. But rebirth in the Brahma
worlds can only be gained as the result of the appropriate karma,
namely the achievement of dhyana. Such states of peace and
calm are impossible in the lower realms, but Buddhaghosa
explains that there is no being in samsara that has not at some
time or other performed the karma necessary for rebirth in the
happy realms of the sense-sphere. Thus even beings born in
hell realms as the result of the severest unwholesome karma will
always have a latent good karma that can come to fruition at
the time of the pending contraction of the world-system. Once
reborn in a sense-sphere heaven, they subsequently cultivate
the dhyana leading to rebirth in the Brahma-worlds. On this view
all beings must at some time have dwelt in the Brahma-realms

The Buddhist Cosmos 125

corresponding to the second, third, and fourth dhydnas, and
periodically—though the periods may be of inconceivable dura-
tion—all beings return to these realms. But according to others,
such as Vasubandhu and Dhammapala, at the time of destruc-
tion hell beings whose unwholesome karma is not exhausted are
reborn in a world-system not in the process of contraction.

Such mythic accounts may seem fantastic, yet embedded within
them are important points of Buddhist thinking, such as, for
example, the suggestion that all beings have the latent potential
to attain—and indeed have some distant knowledge and experi-
ence of—the condition of the fourth dhyana. The condition of
the mind in the fourth dhydna is, according to the classical the-
ory of the stages of the Buddhist path, pivotal to the attainment
of the awakening knowledge itself. The fourth dhyana represents
a particular clear and open state of mind in which the awakening
knowledge can arise. The suggestion that every being in samsara
in some sense already knows such a state introduces a theme that
becomes particularly significant in certain strands of Indian
Mahayana Buddhist thought, and which is especially emphasized
in Japanese Zen. I am referring to the notion of tathagata-garbha
or the inherent ‘Buddha-nature’ of all beings, about which I shall
say more in Chapter 9.

In a certain sense the elaborate and fantastic traditional cos-
mology of Buddhism is nothing more than a full account of all
possible experience: this is the world, the universe in its entirety.
It may not be circumscribed spatially and temporally but there
is no possible manner of being or conceivable experience that is
not included here. Wherever one goes, whatever one experiences,
it is encompassed by this-map of samsara. For Buddhist the-
ory the cosmological scheme defines the round of rebirth—the
uncertain, unstable, changing conditioned world of time and
space—in its entirety. Thus just as in day-to-day experience one
fails to find any physical or mental condition that is not change-
able, that can give permanent satisfaction and happiness, so, even
if one is reborn in the condition of a Brahma living 84,000 aeons,
the calm and peaceful condition of one’s existence is not ulti-
mately lasting or secure. Just as our ordinary happinesses are in

126 The Buddhist Cosmos

this sense duhkha, so too are the lives of the Brahmas even though
they experience no physical or mental pain.

It is a curious fact of the developed cosmological scheme
that it comprises just thirty-one realms. There is some reason for
thinking that the number thirty-two connotes completion and
fulfilment in Buddhist thought: the body is described as con-
sisting of thirty-two parts; the Great Man has a body with thirty-
two marks. Yet samsara has only thirty-one realms. What is
missing is nirvana. But then nirvana is precisely not a state or
condition that can be defined spatially or temporally; one can-
not be reborn in nirvana, nor can one come to nirvana however
far or long one journeys:

That the end of the world where one is not born, does not age, does not
die, does not pass away, does not reappear is to be known, seen or reached
by travelling—that I do not say .. . And yet I do not say that one makes
an end of suffering without reaching the end of the world. Rather in
this fathom-long body, with its perceptions and mind, I declare the world,
the arising of the world, the ceasing of the world, and the way leading
to the ceasing of the world.’”

The Buddhist cosmological account represents the complete
description of the conditioned world—the whirling circle (vatta)
of samsara. This is duhkha on the macrocosmic scale. One’s per-
sonal day-to-day experiences, on the other hand, are duhkha on
the microcosmic scale. In short, what we experience from day
to day is a microcosm of the cosmos at large. As we shall see in
Chapter 6, for Buddhist thought the law that governs the workings
of both the microcosm of individual experience from moment
to moment and also the birth and death of beings across vast aeons
is one and the same: ‘dependent arising’ (pratitya samutpada/
paticca-samuppdda).

Cosmology, folk religion, and modern science

Ihave suggested that the elaborate Buddhist cosmological schema
that we have been considering is in part to be understood by
reference to Buddhist psychology. The equivalence between

The Buddhist Cosmos 127

psychology and cosmology is old and to be regarded as intrinsic
to the system and not a stratagem employed by Buddhist mod-
ernist apologetics in order to render a primitive, pre-modern
understanding of the world palatable to contemporary tastes. Yet
this should not be taken as meaning that Buddhist cosmological
descriptions were traditionally read simply as accounts of mental
states in symbolic and imaginative language. Quite clearly they
were not, nor are they so read in traditional Buddhist cultures
today. For many Buddhists, in the present as in the past, the beings
and realms described in the cosmology are as ‘real’ as the Queen
of England and Buckingham Palace. Yet equally clearly there
can be intellectually more naive and more sophisticated ways
of understanding the Buddhist cosmological world-view. But
again we should avoid coming to the conclusion that somehow
the psychological interpretation represents the ‘real’ Buddhist
understanding, whereas a literal understanding feeds the pop-
ular imagination and, as such, must be suffered by sophisticated
intellectuals. What we have to do with here is a question of a dif-
ferent conception of the nature of ‘reality’: a conception that allows
what we would call a psychological and symbolic interpretation
to coexist with a literal interpretation. Whatever ultimate inter-
pretation one puts on traditional Buddhist cosmology, it remains
a flexible framework within which to make sense of a rich spec-
trum of experience.

Nevertheless at another practical level this cosmological frame-
work has allowed Buddhism to accommodate and take under
its wing certain aspects of what might be called, for want of a
better term, ‘folk religion’. This process of accommodation is as
old as Buddhism itself—perhaps older. Many of the gods and dif-
ferent kinds of being found in the ancient cosmology have been
absorbed into the Buddhist scheme of things from pre-existing
folk and religious traditions. In precisely the same way they have
been absorbed and adapted by Jain and Brahmanical tradition.
Thus figures such as Brahma and Sakra or Indra, such classes of
being as Asuras, Gandharvas (celestial musicians), Yaksas and
Yaksinis, Raksasas (types of demon and nymph), Nagas (myth-
ical serpents), Garudas (mythical birds), and other classes of minor

128 The Buddhist Cosmos

deities dwelling in forests, groves, and trees—all these form part
of a vast Indian mythical and folk-religious heritage that the vari-
ous Indian traditions draw upon.

Each tradition preserves slightly different accounts of these
beings; in each tradition they are adapted and reinterpreted, tak-
ing on slightly different characters and acquiring particular asso-
ciations, while still retaining certain common features. In the fully
developed Buddhist cosmology, these sorts of beings are gener-
ally associated with the gods of the lower sense-sphere heavens.
But their presence in the Buddhist scheme of things in part
reflects a simple fact of the cultural milieu in which Buddhism
grew. We are concerned here with something which is in prin-
ciple as relevant to Indian religion today as it was 2,000 years
ago. Then as now most people lived in a world alive with fairies,
demons, goblins, ghosts, nymphs, dragons, angels, as well as vari-
ous gods. Such beings are as real to people’s experience as any
human being. For the most part in the context of the practice of
contemporary Hinduism, the interaction and dealings with such
beings concerns matters of day-to-day living rather than ques-
tions of the ultimate cessation of suffering. Thus such beings
are seen as causing various kinds of disease by ‘possessing’ one;
or they may be able to grant fulfilment of certain aspirations,
help with a harvest or passing an exam; the acknowledgement
of these beings assists the smooth running of day-to-day matters
and grants a measure of protection against calamity.'*

The various cultures beyond India where Buddhism has estab-
lished itself over the last 2,500 years have been very similar to
India herself in this respect. The existence of various kinds of
beings has been taken for granted, as has the fact that they may
be able to assist in limited ways with everyday human affairs.
In this manner Buddhism has been able to accommodate and
coexist with a considerable range of local and indigenous reli-
gious practice wherever it has established itself. Thus the Bud-
dhists of Sri Lanka visit the shrines of various local and Hindu
gods, the Buddhists of Burma have various rites associated
with a class of being known as nats, while the Thais seek the
assistance of the phiis; Japanese Buddhists worship at the Shinto

The Buddhist Cosmos 129

shrines of the kami; Tibetan Buddhists acknowledge the exist-
ence of various kinds of spirit and god, invoking the presence
of some as ‘protectors of Dharma’ (chos skyong).!° Such beha-
viour troubled some early Western observers of the practice of
Buddhism in its traditional cultures and led them to conclude that
the people who participated in these practices were not ‘true’
Buddhists. This conclusion was based in part on a failure to appre-
ciate the nature of the relationship between this kind of practice
and the cultivation of the Buddhist path; in part on an image of
Buddhism artificially constructed from a selective reading of early
Buddhist texts; and in part on an exclusivist conception of the
nature of ‘a religion’—one is either a Hindu or a Buddhist, one
cannot be both—which is inappropriate to the Asian context.

It has sometimes been claimed that the belief that such beings
can answer one’s pleas for assistance flies in the face of the
Buddhist theory of karma: expecting a god to provide the cure
for an illness must be inconsistent with the belief that falling
ill is the inevitable result of one’s own previous unwholesome
actions.” But this is to misunderstand the Buddhist theory of ac-
tion and result, which is not a species of determinism. From the
Buddhist perspective certain experiences in life are indeed the
results of previous actions; but our responses to those experiences,
whether wished for or unwished for, are not predetermined but
represent new actions which in time bear their own fruit in the
future. The Buddhist understanding of individual responsibility
does not mean that we should never seek or expect another’s
assistance in order to better cope with the troubles of life. The
belief that one’s broken leg is at one level to be explained as the
result of unwholesome actions performed in a previous life does
not mean that one should not go to a doctor to have the broken
leg set. There was and is no need in Buddhist theory to deny the
existence of ‘divine’ beings or to repudiate the Buddhist villager’s
efforts to get their help. The only comment that Buddhist theory
has to make in this context is that divine beings—like doctors—
won’t be able to get to the root of the problem: they may help
one get what one wants in the short term, but they are unable to
bring about the final cessation of suffering.

130 The Buddhist Cosmos

The world of the earliest Buddhist texts is a world, like the
contemporary Indian villager’s, alive with various kinds of being.
The Buddha and his followers are represented as being visited
by these various beings, as having discussions with them, as teach-
ing them, as being questioned by them, and as being honoured
by them. Yet in their reading of the texts many nineteenth-
and early twentieth-century scholars felt inclined to treat such
accounts of ‘supernatural’ beings as later mythical additions to
an earlier more sober and purely philosophical stratum of Bud-
dhist literature that was originally uncluttered by such material.
Indeed this outlook continues to influence the approach of some
scholars. Yet the fact remains that these so-called mythical ele-
ments are so embedded in, so entangled with the conceptual,
ethical, and philosophical dimensions of early Buddhist literat-
ure that the task of extricating them is extremely problematic.
The arguments for excising the mythic material often become
circular: we know that the mythic passages are later because early
Buddhist teaching was a purely ethical and philosophical system
uninterested in myth, and we know that early Buddhist teaching
was devoid of myth because the mythic passages are later.

What can be said with certainty is that we have no evidence,
either in the ancient texts or in the different-contemporary tra-
ditions, for a ‘pure’ Buddhism that does not recognize, accom-
modate, and interact with various classes of ‘supernatural’ being.
Such a pure Buddhism is something of a theoretical and schol-
arly abstraction. This point needs particular stress in relation
to Theravada Buddhism since the notion that the Theravada tra-
dition represents—or ought to represent—a pure, unadulterated
tradition of precisely this kind is widespread and yet is a largely
theoretically constructed model of what Theravada Buddhism is.

I suggested above that a Buddhist’s dealings with and inter-
action with ghosts, demons, and spirits is for the most part tangen-
tial to his or her practice of the Buddhist path. This is certainly
so, and yet the separateness of these two dimensions of a Bud-
dhist’s life can be over-emphasized. In the earliest texts the world
of the Yaksas, Nagas, Gandharvas, and so on merges with the
world of the sense-sphere devas. Such beings precisely acquire

The Buddhist Cosmos 131

ethical and spiritual associations in the theory and practice of
ancient Buddhism, and such associations are not irrelevant to
our appreciation of the role of the gods in the practice of con-
temporary Buddhism. A traditional Buddhist contemplative medi-
tation exercise involves the recollection of the qualities of the
gods (devatanussati) as beings who have arrived at a fortunate
and happy condition as a result of their good karma;

There are the gods of the Four Kings, the gods of the Thirty-Three, the
Yama gods, the Contented gods, the gods who Delight in Creation, the
Masters of the Creations of Others, the gods of Brahma, and yet higher
gods. Endowed with faith those gods passed away from the human realm
and were reborn in that condition; such faith is present in me too. Endowed
with virtue, learning, generosity, and wisdom those gods passed away
from the human realm and were reborn in that condition; such virtue,
learning, generosity, and wisdom are present in me too.”!

The kind of thinking indicated by this passage suggests how the
world of ghosts, demons, spirits, and gods merges and blends
with the world of Buddhist practice. But perhaps the most graphic
illustration of this comes from Buddhist art. Early stone reliefs
depicting the Buddha’s enlightenment show the gods of various
kinds gathering around the tree of awakening. The Great Stipa
at Sajict (second century BcE), a representation of the cosmos
itself, is encircled by a walkway entered by four gateways; here
the decoration depicts animals, Yaksas and Yaksinis, Nagas and
Gandharvas, and the gods; at the centre is the great dome of the
stipa enshrining sacred relics. The interior of Buddhist shrine
rooms through the ages has similarly often been decorated with
murals depicting the various realms and beings of the cosmos.
In conclusion it is worth considering briefly Buddhist and
Indian cosmology in relation to the cosmology of the West.
Clearly the Buddhist conception of the spatial and temporal
extent of the universe contrasts markedly with the traditional
Judaeo-Christian conception of a single world beginning with its
creation at a particular point—a point that has on occasion been
defined very precisely: Archbishop Ussher (1581-1656) calculated
it as 4004 BcE. Whereas from the Buddhist perspective there are

132 The Buddhist Cosmos

countless world-systems passing through vast cycles of expan-
sion and contraction, in the Judaeo-Christian perspective there
is one world whose ‘history’ begins at one point and moves
towards one final doomsday, and is to be read, moreover, as the
working out of God’s purpose. There is a point of real contrast
here that is not of purely theoretical interest; these two tradi-
tional cosmologies give rise to quite different cultural perspect-
ives on matters of social and political progress. This is a complex
subject, and I merely draw the reader’s attention to it.

A number of writers over the last twenty years have suggested
that there is a certain affinity between aspects of traditional
Indian cosmology and the findings of modern astronomy and
physics.” Some caution is needed here. Quite clearly the con-
ception of the cakra-vada taken as a literal description of the
geography of the world (which it clearly was and is by many) is
as inaccurate from a scientific perspective as anything found in
the biblical Judaeo-Christian cosmologies. Curiously though,
the traditional conception of the cakra-vada persisted in Indian
thought even after the realization, early in the Christian era, that
the world was in reality a globe.” The fact that these two quite
different conceptions of the world continued to live side by
side suggests that in part their functions are somewhat different.
Nevertheless, the notion of Mount Meru can fare no better in
the eyes of modern science than that of the Garden of Eden. Yet
Buddhist cosmology’s understanding of the age and size of the
universe, its countless world-systems, the absence of a creator
God, do perhaps sit more comfortably with certain of the notions
of modern astronomy and physics than a Judaeo-Christian
biblical cosmology. Yet it would be naive to suggest that they
somehow anticipate such modern scientific theories. The language
of Buddhist cosmology is not the language of modern physics. If
we wish to understand it, the Buddhist tradition itself suggests
that we should look no further than our own minds, for in many
respects the workings of the vast cosmos are nothing other than
the workings of our minds writ large.

No Self
Personal Continuity and Dependent Arising

The Buddhist critique of self as unchanging

The story of the journeying monk in the Kevaddha Sutta (see above,
Ppp. 113-14) is in fact a very precise parable of Buddhist thought.
To understand the nature of duhkha is precisely to reach the lim-
its of the world. Ultimately the monk in the story is directed to
the nature of the mind itself, for it is here that the secret of the
arising of the world, the ceasing of the world, and the way lead-
ing to the ceasing of the world is to be found. Thus, although
from a particular perspective the elaborate cosmology outlined
in the previous chapter does indeed represent the complete
Buddhist description of duhkha, nevertheless it is in the analy-
sis of individual experience of the world—this fathom-long body
with its perceptions and mind—that duhkha’s ultimate nature is
to be penetrated. In this chapter I wish to turn to the basic prin-
ciples of that Buddhist understanding of our individual experi-
ence of the world, and of consciousness and its workings.

The Buddhist critique of the notion of ‘self’ or dtman is rooted
in a specific historical context and initially directed towards par-
ticular understandings of the notion of self. The evidence of brah-
manical, Jain, and Buddhist sources points towards the existence
in north India of the fifth century BcE of a considerable variety
of views and theories concerning the ultimate nature of the indi-
vidual and his destiny.

Among the questions the early brahmanical texts known as
the Upanisads seek to explore are: to whom or what the various
experiences and parts of a being belong; who or what controls
them; what is the ultimate nature of a being’s self. The standard

134 No Self

term that the Upanisads use for the ‘self’ in its ultimate nature
is dtman, which, although also employed as the ordinary word
for ‘self’ in Sanskrit, may etymologically be derived from a word
originally meaning ‘breath’. For the early Upanisads such as the
Brhadaranyaka and Chandogya (sixth century BcE), the self in
its ultimate nature is a mysterious, ungraspable entity; it is the
unseen seer, the unheard hearer, the unthought thinker, the
unknown knower; it is the inner controller; it is what is immor-
tal in us.’ Although it is much easier to say what it is not than to
specify it concretely, certain quite definite things can be said of
it. This ultimate metaphysical self is the unchanging constant under-
lying all our various and unstable experiences. As such it is inde-
structible and ultimately unaffected by any specific experience
and quite beyond suffering:

The self is not this and not that. Ungraspable it is certainly not grasped;
indestructible it is certainly not destroyed, without clinging it is certainly
not clung to; unbound it comes to no harm, it does not suffer.

Furthermore the immortal indestructible atman that is the ulti-
mate self is, according to the early Upanisads, to be identified
with the underlying ground of all reality known as brahman. In
the final analysis I am not something different from the under-
lying ground of the universe itself. This is the famous Upanisadic
equation of dtman and brahman.

This does not appear to be the only notion of the dtman
known to Buddhist texts. In later Indian thought we find the
concept of a plurality of eternal unchanging ‘selves’, each cor-
responding in some way to individual beings in the world. Such
a teaching is characteristic of the Indian schools of philosophy
known as Samkhya and Yoga and seems to be adumbrated in the
Upanisad of Svet@Svatara.* What we have, then, in the notions
of both the universal and individual atman is an assumption of
an unchanging and constant self that somehow underlies and is
the basis for the variety of changing experiences; moreover this
unchanging self is to be identified as what we ultimately are and
as beyond suffering. It is this general understanding of the self
that early Buddhist thought seeks to examine and question.

No Self 135

While this specific historical context dictates the terms of
reference, it is none the less the case that the issues raised by
the Buddhist critique of self touch on universal problems of per-
sonal identity. Our everyday linguistic usage of terms such as ‘Il’
amounts in practice to an understanding of self as precisely an
unchanging constant behind experiences. Thus when someone
declares, ‘I was feeling sad, but now I am feeling happy,’ he or
she implies by the term ‘I’ that there is a constant, unchanging
thing that underlies and links the quite different experiences of
happiness and sadness. Linguistic usage and no doubt certain
emotional and psychological circumstances predispose us to an
understanding of personal identity and selfhood in terms of an
‘T’ that exists as an autonomous individual and who has various
experiences. In this way I assume—perhaps unconsciously—that
although my experiences may vary there is something—me—that
remains constant. In other words, it only makes sense to talk in
terms of my having experiences if there is a constant ‘T’ that can
somehow be considered apart from and separately from those
experiences. It is in this conceptual framework that Buddhist
thought begins to ask various questions about the nature of the
‘I’, the constant unchanging self underlying experience.

One task that Buddhist thought attempts is a descriptive ana-
lysis of the nature of experience, or, to put it simply, of just what
it is that seems to be going on all the time. This exercise is in
fact one of the preoccupations of Buddhist thought and it offers
a number of ways of analysing the nature of experience which
are integrated in the complex Abhidharma systems of the devel-
oped schools of Buddhist thought. Perhaps the most important
analysis of individual experience found in the early texts and
carried over into the Abhidharma is an account in terms of the
five ‘aggregates’ or ‘groups’ (skandha/khandha) of physical and
mental events.

The list and description of the five skandhas represent a
response to such questions as: what is a being? what is going on?
what is there? In the first place I can say that I seem to have a
body with five senses of sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch.
There is then the physical world, what the Buddhist texts call

136 No Self

‘form’ (rapa). In the second place there is variety of mental
activity going on, much of it in direct response to the various
physical stimuli. Thus my experiences continuously produce in
me pleasant, unpleasant, or indifferent feelings (vedanda). I am
also continuously classifying and sorting my experiences such
that, confronted by various sense stimuli, there can be recog-
nition (samjfda/sanfa) of something as an ‘apple’ or a ‘cup of
tea’.© Furthermore, my experiences seem to provoke various
desires, wishes, and tendencies—volitional ‘forces’ or ‘formations’
(samskara/samkhara); thus, if I perceive an apple when I am
hungry, quite strong desires may arise which may lead to my
being unable to resist reaching out and taking it; in fact, given a
variety of circumstances, the emotions produced in response to
my experiences may lead to all sorts of actions from self-sacrifice
to vicious murder. Finally we can say that there is a basic self-
consciousness (vijfidna/vinnana)—an awareness of ourselves as
thinking subjects having a series of perceptions and thoughts. In
this way my individual experience can be analysed as consisting
of various phenomena that can be conveniently classified as
forming five collections or aggregates: bodily phenomena, feel-
ings, labelling or recognizing, volitional activities, and conscious
awareness.

Buddhist thought presents these five aggregates as an exhaust-
ive analysis of the individual. They are the world for any given
being—there is nothing else besides. The question now arises
whether any given instance of these five groups of phenomena
can qualify as a ‘self’-—an unchanging, constant underlying experi-
ence. Steven Collins effectively identifies three arguments for the
denial of the self in early Buddhist texts.’

One of the Upanisadic characterizations of the self was as the
‘inner controller’, and the first argument employed is that in fact
we have no ultimate control over any of the five aggregates:

Body is not a self. If body were a self then it might be that it would not
lead to sickness; then it might be possible to say, ‘Let my body be like
this, let my body not be like this.’ But since body is not a self, so it leads
to sickness, and it is not possible to say, ‘Let my body be like this, let
my body not be like this.”*

No Self 137

The same can be said of feeling, recognition, volitions, and con-
scious awareness. It is simply ridiculous to take things that are
bound up with change and sickness, and over which we have no
ultimate control as self.

A second argument against the self is to be found in the fol-
lowing exchange between the Buddha and his monks, which
occurs frequently in the earliest Buddhist texts, sometimes but-
tressing the argument from lack of control. The Buddha asks:

‘What do you think, monks? Are body .. . feeling . . . recognition . . . voli-
tions . .. conscious awareness permanent or impermanent?’

‘Impermanent, lord.’

‘But is something that is impermanent painful or unpainful?’

‘Painful, lord.’

‘But is it fitting to regard something that is painful, whose nature it
is to change as “this is mine, I am this, this is my self”?’

‘Certainly not, lord.’

‘Therefore, monks, all body... feeling ... recognition . . . volitions
... conscious awareness whatsoever, whether past, present or future,
whether gross or subtle, inferior or refined, far or near, should be seen
by means of clear understanding as it really is, as “this is not mine, I am
not this, this is not my self”.”

That something which is impermanent must be regarded as
‘painful’ (duhkha) follows, of course, from principles we have
already found expressed in the second of the four noble truths:
if we become attached and try to hold on to things that will
inevitably change and disappear, then we are bound to suffer.
This argument also seems to be aimed directly at the early
Upanisadic notion of the self as an unchanging, eternal absolute
that is free from all suffering; in the phrase ‘this is not mine, I
am not this, this is not my self’ there appears to be a deliberate
echo and rebuttal of the Chandogya Upanisad’s ‘this is the self,
this is what you are’.!°

A third argument centres on the meaninglessness of the term
‘self’ apart from particular experiences.’ There are three pos-
sibilities: one must regard the self as the same as experience, or
one must regard the self as something apart from experience, or
one must regard the self as having the attribute of experience.

138 No Self

But none of these ways of viewing the self is coherent. The
first method, in failing to distinguish the self from changing
experiences, ends up with a self that continuously changes as our
experiences change; but a self, by definition, is something that
does not change as experiences change, it is the unchanging
thing behind those experiences. The second method makes no
sense either since (in a kind of inversion of the Cartesian ‘I think
therefore I am’), apart from experiences, how can one possibly
think of oneself as existing? So we are left with the third pos-
sibility, namely a self that is something different from experi-
ence, yet not without experience; a self that experiences or has
the attribute of experience. Such a self must still in some sense
be distinguishable from experiences, yet there is no basis upon
which to make such a distinction, since it remains the case that
apart from particular experiences it is not possible to think of
oneself as existing.

The gist of the Buddhist critique of the notion of ‘self’ is then
this. It cannot be denied that there is a complex of experience
going on; this can be conveniently analysed by way of the five
aggregates. But where precisely in all this is the constant, un-
changing self which is having all these experiences? What we find
when we introspect, the Buddha suggests, is always some par-
ticular sense datum, some particular feeling, some particular idea,
some particular wish or desire, some consciousness of some-
thing particular. And all these are constantly changing from one
moment to the next; none of them remains for more than a mere
moment. Thus, apart from some particular experience, I never
actually directly come across or experience the ‘T’ that is having
experiences. It is something entirely elusive. This looks suspicious.
How can I know it is there? For it is impossible to conceive of
consciousness apart from all these particular changing details, and
if we abstract all the particular details of consciousness we are
not left with a constant, individual ‘self’ but a blank, a nothing.

The early Upanisads themselves acknowledged that the self
was something of a mysterious, ungraspable entity, but—and here
Buddhist thought lays down its challenge—perhaps its nature is
actually so mysterious and ungraspable that it does not make

No Self 139

any coherent sense at all. Thus Buddhist thought suggests that
as an individual I am a complex flow of physical and mental
phenomena, but peel away these phenomena and look behind
them and one just does not find a constant self that one can call
one’s own. My sense of self is both logically and emotionally just
a label that I impose on these physical and mental phenomena in
consequence of their connectedness. In other words, the idea of
self as a constant unchanging thing behind the variety of experi-
ence is just a product of linguistic usage and the particular way
in which certain physical and mental phenomena are experienced
as connected.

An ancient Buddhist text, the Milindapafha (‘Milinda’s Ques-
tions’) records the meeting of a Buddhist monk and the local
Bactrian Greek king, Milinda or Menander. The monk introduces
himself as Nagasena, but then adds that this is just a convenient
label, for in reality no ‘person’ can be found. The king is puzzled
and accuses the monk of talking nonsense. Nagasena then asks
how the king came to this hermitage, and the king replies that
he came in a chariot. ‘But what is a chariot?’, asks Nagasena. Is
it the pole? Is it the axle? Is it the wheels, or the framework,
or the yoke, or the reins? King Milinda is forced to admit that it
is none of these. Nevertheless, he persists, it is not meaningless
to talk of a ‘chariot’, for the term is used as a convenient label
in dependence upon pole, axle, wheels, framework, yoke, reins,
etc. Just so, responds Nagasena, it is not meaningless to talk of
“‘Nagasena’, for terms such as ‘Nagasena’ or ‘being’ are used as
convenient labels when all the relevant constituents—the five
aggregates—are present, yet there is no such independent thing
as ‘Nagasena’ or ‘a being’.’

Language and the fact that experiences are somehow connected
fools us into thinking that there is an ‘I’ apart from and behind
changing experiences—apart from the fact of experiences being
connected. In reality, as we shall presently see, for Buddhist thought
there is only their ‘connectedness’—nothing besides that. The fact
that experiences are causally connected is not to be explained
by reference to an unchanging self that underlies experience, but
by examining the nature of causality.

140 No Self

The problem of personal continuity: self as
‘causal connectedness’

We have seen how Buddhist thought criticizes the concept of
an unchanging self .as incoherent; however, both ancient and
modern critics have argued that to do away with the self in the
manner of Buddhist thought in fact creates insurmountable
philosophical and moral problems. How can the experienced facts
of personal continuity—after all it is I who remember getting
up this morning and going to the shops, not you—be accounted
for? Again, central to the Buddhist world-view is the notion
of rebirth, but surely for this to be meaningful some part of a
person must remain constant and be reborn, which is precisely
what the teaching of no self seems to deny. Furthermore, if there
is no self, is not the whole foundation of morality undermined?
If I am not the same person as the one who robbed the bank
yesterday, how can I be held responsible? In fact does not the
teaching of no self render life meaningless and is it not tanta-
mount to a doctrine of nihilism? For its part, Buddhist thought
claims that it has adequate answers to these questions and has
always categorically denied the charge that it is a species of
nihilism.'* The answers to these questions are all in one way or
another to be referred to the particular Buddhist understanding
of the way in which things are causally connected.

We have seen how Buddhist thought breaks down-an individ-
ual into five classes of physical and mental events known as skand-
has or ‘aggregates’. But the list of five aggregates represents only
one of various possible ways of analysing the constituents of a
being. An alternative analysis sees the individual as comprising
twelve ‘spheres’ (Zyatana): the six senses (five physical senses and
mind) and the six classes of object of those senses; a variation of
this talks of eighteen ‘elements’ (dhdatu): six senses, six classes
of sense object, and six classes of consciousness.'* For Buddhist
thought the physical and mental events that comprise a being
and his or her experiences can be analysed, grouped, and viewed
from a number of different perspectives. But whatever the per-
spective, the concern is to show that physical and mental events

No Self 141

occur in various relationships to each other. As such, physical
and mental events or phenomena are termed dharmas (Pali
dhamma). This is a term whose full discussion must be reserved
for Chapter 7, but it can be defined in the present context as
an ultimate ‘event’ or ‘reality’ that, in combination with other
ultimate events or realities, constitutes the basis of reality as a
whole. The occurrence of physical and mental events is not just
arbitrary or random; on the contrary there is a deep and real rela-
tionship of causal connectedness between events or phenomena.
And it is the concern with the nature of this causal connected-
ness that lies at the heart of Buddhist philosophy and which is
seen as validating all Buddhist practice.

A story has it that the wanderer Sariputra’s introduction to
the teaching of the Buddha was in the form of a summary verse
recited to him by the monk ASvajit:

Of those dharmas which arise from a cause, the Tathagata has stated
the cause, and also the cessation; such is the teaching of the Great Ascetic.

Hearing this verse, Sariputra immediately gained a profound insight
into the Dharma, although he was not to become an awakened
arhat for another fortnight.!* The verse thus encapsulates the
Buddha’s teaching and as such states the secret of the cessa-
tion of suffering—if we could but understand it. Later Buddhist
tradition regarded this verse as possessing an almost magical
potency, and in ancient times, throughout the Buddhist world,
it was inscribed on bricks, metal plates, and images to make a
protective amulet that might be worn or enshrined in stiipas.'°
Another succinct formula states the principle of causality (idam-
pratyayata) as ‘this existing, that exists; this arising, that arises;
this not existing, that does not exist; this ceasing, that ceases’.’”
But the most important statement of the Buddhist understand-
ing of how causality operates is in terms of the twelve links (nidana)
of the chain of ‘dependent arising’ (pratitya-samutpada/paticca-
samuppada):

Conditioned by (1) ignorance are (2) formations, conditioned by
formations is (3) consciousness, conditioned by consciousness is (4)
mind-and-body, conditioned by mind-and-body are (5) the six senses,

142 No Self

conditioned by the six senses is (6) sense-contact, conditioned by sense-
contact is (7) feeling, conditioned by feeling is (8) craving, conditioned
by craving is (9) grasping, conditioned by grasping is (10) becoming,
conditioned by becoming is (11) birth, conditioned by birth is (12) old-
age and death—grief, lamentation, pain, sorrow, and despair come into
being. Thus is the arising of this whole mass of suffering.'*

The verse and the succinct formula state baldly that the secret
of the universe lies in the nature of causality—the way one thing
leads to another. The chain of twelve links goes rather fur-
ther; it attempts to reveal the actual pattern and structure of
causal conditioning. And we are told in the ancient texts that he
who sees dependent arising—this pattern of conditioning—sees
Dharma itself.'°

According to Buddhist analysis a person should be seen as
five classes of physical and mental events that arise dependently
at any given moment in time and also over a period of time.
What this means then is that the causal connectedness of events
is such that events occur in certain quite specific clusters and
patterns. From this perspective a ‘person’ is a series of clusters
of events (physical and mental) occurring in a ‘human’ pattern,
as opposed to, say, the canine pattern of a ‘dog’. Furthermore,
causal connectedness is such that the patterns in which events
occur tend to reproduce themselves and so are relatively stable
over a period of time. Thus it does not happen that a man is aman
one moment and a dog the next, rather over a period of time a
baby becomes a child, and a child an adult. So although I am not
now the same person as I was when I was 3 years old in that there
is no single part of me that is the same as it was, there is never-
theless a continuous causal connectedness between the clusters
and pattern of physical and mental events that occurred thirty-
five years ago, and those occurring now. The ‘person’ that is me
thus subsists not in some entity remaining constant for thirty-five
years but merely in the fact that certain clusters of physical and
mental events are linked causally.

In other words, Buddhist thought understands change not in
terms of a primary substantial essence remaining constant while
its secondary qualities change, but solely in terms of the causal

No Self 143

connectedness of different qualities. There is no primary substance
to remain constant:

There is neither identity nor difference in a sequence of continuity. For
if there were complete identity in a sequence of continuity there would
be no curds produced from the milk; if there were complete difference
the owner of the milk would not own the curds. This is the case with all
conditioned things.”

What is more, this causal connectedness of events does not
suddenly cease at the death of a ‘person’. In fact death from the
perspective of the Buddhist understanding of the causal con-
nectedness of events is simply the breaking up of a particular
configuration of those events. As I have said, the stability of
particular configurations of events is only relative; eventually it
must break down. But the nature of the causal connectedness of
physical and mental events is such that as soon as one particu-
lar configuration breaks down events begin to build themselves
into a new one. This then is ‘rebirth’. The new pattern of events,
although certainly connected with the old, may be of a different
kind. A man may be reborn as an animal; a god may be reborn
as a man.

Although I have been talking in terms of physical and mental
events, one should note that in the breaking down of a particu-
lar configuration of events that is death, it is the mental events
that are crucially determinative of the nature of the new pattern
of events, for as we saw in the previous chapter, the workings of
karma, of action and result, are essentially a matter of intention.
We have now returned from the microcosm of a person consist-
ing of patterns of events arising and ceasing to the macrocosm
of the universe of beings passing through cycles of birth, death,
and rebirth.

Let me sum up the Buddhist response to the questions I posed
at the beginning of this section. The basic experienced facts
of personal continuity are to be explained not with reference to
an enduring substantial self, but with reference to the particular
way in which the phenomena that make up a being are causally
connected. And just as this causal connectedness is the basis of

144 No Self

continuity within a particular life, so it is the basis of continu-
ity between lives. Just as no substantial self endures during a
lifetime, so no substantial self endures from death to rebirth.
None the less there is a causal connection between the phenomena
that constitute a being at the time of death and the phenomena
that constitute a being at the start of a new life. This linking
(pratisandhi/patisandhi) of different lives into a causal series,
such that we can speak of someone being reborn as someone
else, is understood as a particular function of mental phenomena
(rather than physical phenomena); death is then not an interruption
in the causal flow of phenomena, it is simply the reconfiguring
of events into a new pattern in dependence upon the old. Thus,
when asked whether the one who is reborn is the same or dif-
ferent from the one who died, the Buddhist tradition replies that
strictly he (or she) is neither the same nor different.”!

The way in which phenomena are causally connected is also
seen as sufficient to account for moral responsibility. The monk
Nagasena put it as follows to King Milinda. Suppose that some-
one should steal some mangoes from another man’s trees; if he
were to claim in his defence that the mangoes he stole were not
the mangoes the other man planted, we would point out that the
mangoes he stole nevertheless arose in dependence upon the man-
goes that were previously planted. Similarly I cannot, by appeal
to the teaching of no self, claim that it was not I who robbed the
bank yesterday but some other person who no longer exists, since
the teaching of no self states quite categorically that the ‘ who
exists today only exists by virtue of its dependence upon the ‘I’
that existed yesterday; there is a definite causal connection.

Properly understood the principle of the causal connectedness
of phenomena is sufficient, claims Buddhist thought, to answer
critics of the teaching of no self and redeem Buddhism from the
charge of nihilism. Of course, philosophers, ancient and modern,
Indian and Western, need not necessarily accept that this is the
end of the matter and that Buddhist thought has dealt with the
problems of the theory of no self once and for all. Throughout
its history Buddhist philosophy has continued to try to refine both
its treatment of these problems as well as its own critique of the

No Self 145

notion of enduring substances, but this is as far as we need pur-
sue the matter at present. I shall, however, mention two further
dimensions to the teaching of no self here. The first concerns the
notion of ‘the middle way’ and the second the notion of two kinds
of truth.

The understanding that sees a ‘person’ as subsisting in the
causal connectedness of dependent arising is often presented in
Buddhist thought as ‘the middle’ (madhyama/majjhima) between
the views of ‘eternalism’ (SaSvata-/sassata-vada) and ‘annihila-
tionism’ (uccheda-vada).” If we understand a ‘person’ as subsisting
in an unchanging, constant self that underlies different experi-
ences, then, since we have postulated something that endures with-
out change, we have fallen prey to the view of ‘eternalism’; if on
the other hand we understand that there is no real connection
between the person at one point in time and another point in
time, then we have fallen prey to the view of ‘annihilationism’.
In other words, if we deny that there is a real connectedness
between events this is annihilationism, but if we understand that
connectedness in terms of an unchanging self this is eternalism;
the middle way is that there is only the connectedness, there is
only dependent arising.

Part of the Buddhist critique of the concept of self involves
the claim that language predisposes us towards and indeed con-
fuses us into thinking that an enduring self does in fact exist.
Sentences such as ‘I am going to London tomorrow’ suggest that
there is something constant to which the term ‘I’ refers, namely,
my ‘self’; yet in reality, claims Buddhist thought, such a self is
not to be found. However, this does not mean that the terms ‘self’,
‘T’, and so forth are to be systematically removed from all truly
Buddhist discourse. Indeed, such terms are perfectly normal in
Buddhist discourse. Developed Buddhist thought articulates what
is involved here in terms of a distinction between conventional
(samvrti/sammuti) and ultimate (paramartha/paramattha) truth.
From this perspective the Buddhist denial of self is not an abso-
lute denial of self as such, but a quite specific denial of self as
an enduring substance. As we have seen, for Buddhist thought
terms like ‘self’, ‘being’ and ‘person’ are conventional labels for

146 No Self

what in reality is a mass of constantly changing, causally con-
nected physical and mental phenomena. The problem is not with
the words in themselves but with what we understand by the words:
we are misled by their conventional usage into thinking that selves,
beings and persons have an ultimate existence in their own right.
The Buddha, on the other hand, makes use of such words with-
out holding on to them and being led astray.” Thus when a Buddha,
or any other awakened being, says ‘I’, he or she merely uses
the term as a matter of convenience, rather than saying ‘this par-
ticular group of five aggregates’—just as a nuclear physicist will
refer to a ‘table’ rather than ‘a mass of subatomic particles’. So
it is not that it is not true to say that I exist, but that it is only
conventionally true; from the ultimate point of view there are
only five aggregates of physical and mental phenomena.

Ignorance, attachment, and views of the self

The Buddhist critique of the notion of a self rests on the claim
that we never in fact experience an unchanging self, and that there
is therefore no reason to posit an unchanging self underlying
experience. In other words, the idea that one exists as a perman-
ent, unchanging self is born of faulty reasoning based on the fail-
ure to perceive the world as it actually is. This notion of self is
born of delusion (moha) or ignorance (avidyda/avijja). But there
is another strand to the Buddhist critique of the notion of self
which sees it as intimately bound up with craving (trsna@/tanha)
and attachment (upddana).

A passage from the early Buddhist scriptures that I referred
to earlier concludes by stating that someone who succeeds in nei-
ther regarding the self as the same as experience, nor as some-
thing that is apart from experience, nor as something which has
the attribute of experience is thereby one who ‘does not grasp
at anything in the world, and through not grasping he craves no
longer, and through not craving he effects complete nirvana’.
Thus for Buddhist thought, to understand the world in terms
of self is not only to see it wrongly but to be led by greed, de-
sire, and attachment. One’s sense of ‘self’ springs not only from

No Self 147

delusion, but from the desire to identify and claim some part or
parts of the universe as one’s own, as one’s possession, and say
of them ‘this is mine, I am this, this is my self’. To identify with
the five aggregates, either collectively or individually, is a kind
of conceit—the conceit ‘I am’ (asmi-mana).

As a function of both ignorance and greed, the belief in self is
something that we construct, not only at a conscious and intel-
lectual level, but also at a deep psychological and emotional level.
We continually crave to be particular kinds of person. In so far
as they are entangled with craving, the notions of self and of
personal identity can, from the Buddhist point of view, only lead
to suffering—for both ourselves and others. The appropriating
of some part or parts of the universe as mine, as opposed to
yours, the desire to construct my ‘self’ or personal identity, must
lead inevitably to self-ish concerns. It drives me to accumulate
‘possessions’—both physical and psychological—that define and
reinforce my sense of my own selfhood as student, teacher, ban-
ker, lawyer, politician, craftsmen, Buddhist monk—as some
kind of person as opposed to some other kind of person. And
when I feel that what I regard as my self, that what I regard as
by rights mine, is in danger of being taken from me, I become
angry, frustrated, fearful; I may even be driven to violence and
kill. And yet disease, old age and death for sure will take from
me all that I have regarded as mine—body, feelings, ideas, voli-
tions, mind. Indeed an ancient image compares our identifying
ourselves with any of the five aggregates to trying to grasp at vari-
ous kinds of grass, reeds, and rushes as we are being swept along
in a river’s fierce current: they all slip from our grasp or break
away from the bank.” My continued grasping at self in the face
of this fact sets my self over and against others’ selves. We all
become rivals in the fruitless struggle of trying to find something
in the universe which we can grasp and call ‘mine’. Selves thus
cause problems for all concerned, and the aim of Buddhism is
therefore to realize selflessness, both metaphysically and ethically;
or, to borrow the title of Steven Collins’s comprehensive study
of the teaching of no self, the goal of the Buddhist path is to become
a truly ‘self-/ess person’.

148 No Self

The idea of belief in self as something conditioned by greed
is stated as the fourth of the four kinds of grasping mentioned
in the previous chapter: grasping at the doctrine of self. There
are then these two complementary aspects to the Buddhist
critique of self: the claim that the notion is based on a faulty under-
standing of the world; and the claim that it is a function of deep-
seated greed and attachment. Conditioned by these two things
the notion of self brings only suffering into the world.

The Buddhist critique of self is directed at all theories or views
of the self that imply some sort of unchanging self whether that
self is conceived of as eternal, immortal, or merely subsisting
unchanged for the duration of a particular lifetime, or any period
of time. As Professor Norman has shown, the refutation of the
Upanisadic identification of the dtman with the world is the pri-
mary focus of the critique of self contained in the Alagaddiipama
Sutta (‘discourse on the simile of the water-snake’).6 Elsewhere
Buddhist texts attack a whole range of views concerning the self.
We saw above (pp. 137-8) how three specific ways of regarding
the self are dismissed. In another extremely important and
famous text, the Brahmajala Sutta (‘discourse on the supreme
net’), the Buddha gives an account of sixty-two different views,
fifty-four of which concern ways of perceiving the self.7” Many
of these views involve the misinterpretation of meditation expe-
rience: someone experiences some subtle and sublime level of
consciousness in meditation and takes this as the unchanging self
underlying other experiences. Another often repeated passage
gives four different ways of constructing a view of self based
on each of the five aggregates, making twenty varieties of the
view that the individual exists (satkaya-drsti/sakkaya-ditthi): one
regards the body as the self, or the self as possessing body, or
body as in the self, or the self as in body, and so forth.” Yet another
passage describes how someone, tortuously preoccupied with
understanding the nature of self, falls prey to one of six views
about the self:

Thus someone reflects inappropriately, ‘Did I exist in the past? Did I
not exist in the past? What was I in the past? How was I in the past?

No Self 149

... Will I exist in the future? Will I not exist in the future? What will I
be in the future? How will I be in the future?’ Or he is uncertain about
himself in the present, ‘Do I exist? Do I not exist? What am I? How am
I? From where has this being come, and where will it go?’ To one reflect-
ing inappropriately in this way one of six views occurs. The definite and
firm view arises, ‘I have a self’ or, ‘I do not have a self’ or, ‘By the self
I perceive what is self’ or, ‘By the self I perceive what is not self’ or, ‘By
what is not self I perceive what is not self’ or, “That which is my self
here, which speaks, feels, and which experiences at different times the
results of good and bad deeds, will become permanent, constant, eter-
nal, not subject to change.’ This is called being lost to views, the grip of
views, the jungle of views, the turmoil of views, the commotion of views,
the bond of views. Bound by the bond of views the ignorant ordinary
man is not freed from birth, old age and death, from distress, grief and
suffering.”

In this way Buddhist thought sees us as being seduced by greed
and ignorance into constructing all manner of views, opinions,
and beliefs about our selves. Sometimes the view is founded on
elaborate but, from the Buddhist perspective, faulty reasoning;
for some it is everyday experiences that mislead them into
believing in a self, for others it is the more subtle experiences of
meditation that mislead.

The elaboration of the teaching of dependent arising

I introduced above the notion of dependent arising and the for-
mula of twelve links that most commonly describes it. In the earli-
est Buddhist texts there are a number of variations on this list,
some omitting links, some changing the order. This has led some
modern textual scholars to speculate as to the possible stages
in the evolution of the formula. These problems need not con-
cern us here. Whatever its history, it is clear that the twelvefold
formula became standard early in the development of Buddhist
thought. But curiously, apart from stating the formula and using
it in a variety of contexts, the earliest texts give very little explana-
tion of how the formula is to be understood. For that we must
turn to the later manuals of the fifth century ce such as Bud-
dhaghosa’s Visuddhimagga and Vasubandhu’s Abhidharmakosa.©

150 No Self

Both Vasubandhu and Buddhaghosa present as standard a
way of taking the twelvefold formula as relating to three differ-
ent lives of a being (cf. Table 3). In our previous life we have
performed various actions, we have been prey to the various
volitions, impulses, and activities of the mind, both meritorious
and unmeritorious, wholesome and unwholesome, and these
are collectively summed up in the formula as (2) ‘formations’
(samskara/samkhara); although some of our actions have been
wholesome, we never entirely succeed in freeing ourselves from
a fundamentally distorted and partial seeing of the way things
are; like a blind man we stumble from the right road to the wrong
road without really understanding what we are doing;*! thus
(1) ‘ignorance’ (avidya/avijja), as a positive misconception and
not the mere absence of knowledge,” forms the background to
all our past actions, and so the formula begins, ‘conditioned by
ignorance are formations’. In the present we are heirs to these
past deeds. In the process of rebirth at the moment of conception
in our mother’s womb we come into existence with (3) a mind
or consciousness (vijfdna/vifinadna) that is directly conditioned
by these past deeds; in turn this consciousness gives rise to
(4) our basic mental and physical make-up (na@ma-riipa) which
in turn conditions the physical and mental capacities with which
we turn to the world, (5) our five physical senses, and the mind
(Gyatana). Vasubandhu’s Abhidharmako§Sa relates these last two
links to the gradual development of the foetus in the womb.
From the moment of birth by way of these six senses (6) various
sensations (sparsa/phassa) and experiences come to us lead-
ing to (7) pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral feelings (vedana);
Vasubandhu relates this link to the stage in its development when
a child learns to distinguish clearly those things which will bring
pleasure and those that will bring pain. This world of feelings,
some of which we like, some of which we dislike, some of which
we are indifferent towards, gives rise to (8) craving (trsnd/tanha)
for more of the pleasant feelings and fewer of the painful feel-
ings. For Vasubandhu this link is particularly associated with the
awakening of sexual passion at puberty. In response to our crav-
ing we determine on and (9) cling to (upddana) various courses

No Self I5I

of action as the means to bring about the particular pleasant
experiences we repeatedly crave;* and so we carry out these par-
ticular courses of action; as we repeatedly carry them out they
(10) become our particular ways of being (bhava). And so a future
(11) birth (jati) conditioned by these very courses of action must
occur, and whatever is born will once more (12) age and even-
tually die (jara-marana). So the process goes on without any known
beginning or end.

Buddhaghosa gives us the following vivid image of dependent
arising. A blind man (ignorance) stumbles (formations) and falls
(consciousness); as a result of the fall a swelling develops (mind
and body) and on that swelling there forms an abscess which weeps
(six senses); this abscess gets continually knocked and bruised
(contact) causing terrible pain (feeling) which the man longs
to remove (craving); in consequence he seizes on (grasping)
and applies (becoming) to the swelling various remedies that he
thinks will relieve the pain; but instead of relieving the pain their
effect is simply to change the condition of the swelling for the
worse (birth) and finally the whole swelling bursts (old age and
death).*

Theravada commentaries preserve some further points of
analysis of the formula that can be best set out in the form of a
table (see Table 3). In the first place there are three main tran-
sition points (column 2) that divide the twelve links of the for-
mula into four sections (column 3). Thus our previous ignorance
and formations represent the ‘past cause’ of the ‘present fruit’
which consists of the consciousness, mind and body, six senses,
sense-contact, and feeling which we presently experience; the way
we react to this fruit in the present, by way of craving, grasp-
ing and becoming, constitutes the ‘present cause’ that will bear
fruit in the form of the conditions of our future birth, ageing, and
death. Viewing the formula in this way also reveals a certain
symmetry: if links 1 and 2 (ignorance and formations) were active
in the past, then inevitably links 8, 9, and Io (craving, grasping,
and becoming) were also active in the past; similarly if links 8,
g, and 10 are active in the present, so must links 1 and 2 (ignor-
ance and formations); and the future existence of links 11 and 12

(birth, old age, and death) is a shorthand way of referring to the
coming into being and subsequent decay of links 3, 4, 5, 6, and
7 (consciousness, mind and body, six senses, sense-contact, and
feeling) in a future life. In this way, each of the four sections of
column 3 can be seen as comprising five factors, making a total
of twenty, instead of twelve, links.

The formula of dependent arising states that ‘conditioned
by’ a certain phenomenon a certain other phenomenon comes
into being. The Theravadin tradition analyses in some detail the
ways in which a phenomenon can be a condition for another
phenomenon by applying a scheme of twenty-four possible types
of condition to each of the twelve links and detailing which are
relevant in each case.** Another important point made in the
exegetical literature is that, although the formula states just one
condition for each subsequent link, this should not be taken
as suggesting that a single cause is a sufficient condition for the
arising of each further link. Each condition is stated as a repres-
entative and significant cause; the Theravada tradition records
here as a fundamental axiom the principle that a single cause
does not give rise to either a single result or several results; nor
do several causes give rise to just one result; but rather several
causes give rise to several results.*°

The details of all this need not concern us here, and if it
sounds complicated, it is and deliberately so. Yet what is con-
veyed is how we as individual beings—our lives and experience
—consist of a complex web of conditions built around the inter-
action of passive fruits and active causes. I said above that the
formula of dependent arising is intended to reveal the actual
pattern and structure of causality. Buddhist thought does not
understand causality in terms similar to, say, Newtonian mech-
anics, where billiard balls rebound off each other in an entirely
predictable manner once the relevant information is gathered.
First, the Buddhist attempt to understand the ways of causal
conditioning is concerned primarily with the workings of the
mind: the way in which things we think, say, and do have an effect
on both our selves and others. Second, Buddhist thought sees
causal conditioning as involving the interaction of certain fixed

154 No Self

or determined effects and certain free or unpredictable causes.
If, presented with a situation, I deliberately kill another human
being, this action must lead to some unpleasant result in the future;
it may also make it easier for me to kill in the future, eventually
establishing something of a habit; and this may lead me into
circumstances—life as a bandit, say, or rebirth as a tiger—where
the only way to live is by killing; and yet in some measure the
freedom not to kill, not to act in accordance with established habits,
remains.

On the one hand, we are born with a certain mental and phys-
ical make-up, and are presented with various experiences over
which we have no control; on the other hand, we continually choose
certain courses of action in response to what is given us. We like
or do not like our experiences, ourselves, and our bodies, and
we decide to act in certain ways in order to try to change our
lives. But from the Buddhist perspective, because of the funda-
mental condition of ignorance, we fail to act effectively and lose
our way in the labyrinth of conditions that constitutes our being.
That dependent arising is indeed presented by the Buddhist tra-
dition as something profound and, in a sense, difficult and com-
plicated is aptly summed by a saying attributed to the Buddha
himself:

Profound is this dependent arising and profound too is its appearance.
It is through not knowing its nature, not penetrating its nature that beings
become like a tangled skein, like a knotted ball of thread, like a weave
of grass and rushes and fail to pass beyond samsara with its descents,
unhappy destinies, and perdition.*”

While the method of taking the twelvefold formula as describ-
ing a process over three lives is common to the ancient schools,
it is also clear that it should be taken on a number of different
scales—as describing, for example, the process whereby in re-
sponse to some circumstance we determine upon and carry out
one particular course of action.** The Abhidharma tradition of
both the Theravadins and Sarvastivadins points out that the for-
mula should also be applied to each moment of consciousness—
that is, every thought that occurs arises in accordance with this

No Self 155

twelvefold formula. Dependent arising describes the structure
of reality however, wherever, and whenever we dissect it. The
application of the formula to a thought moment has some in-
teresting implications. The formula describes a process, and we
usually conceive of processes as by definition taking place over
a period of time, and yet for the Abhidharma such a process occurs
quite literally in one moment: the twelve links arise simultane-
ously. This is something that touches upon complex tensions
and issues in the history of Buddhist thought. The point that is
being made is that reality is at heart something dynamic, some-
thing fluid; however one looks at it, reality is a process; analyse
reality down to its smallest possible components or constituents,
and what one finds are, not static building blocks, but dynamic
processes. This is vividly summed up in the notion of ‘death’ as
something we live through in each moment:

From the standpoint of ultimate truth the moment of a being’s life is
extremely short—just the occurrence of a single thought. Indeed just
as the rolling wheel of a cart rolls on just one point of its rim, and rest-
ing rests on just one point, exactly so the life of a being lasts but the
moment of one thought, and as soon as that thought has ceased the being
has ceased . . . Life, personality, pleasure and pain all come together in
a single thought—the moment passes swiftly; the aggregates of one who
dies or of one who remains are all alike—gone never to be met with
again. Without the occurrence of thought the world is not born, with
its arising it lives, with its passing it dies. This is understanding in the
ultimate sense.”

Yet again we move from the macrocosm of beings dying and being
reborn to the microcosm of our changing thoughts. But the fact
that reality is at heart a process relates also once more to the
notion of the middle way. True process, true change cannot be
explained either in terms of eternalism (a thing exists unchang-
ing) or annihilationism (a thing exists for a time and then ceases
to exist). The process of change as described by dependent aris-
ing is thus a middle between these two extremes, encapsulating
the paradox of identity and difference involved in the very notion
of change.

156 No Self

Buddhaghosa thus records that the teaching of dependent
arising makes four points.” (1) It shows that there is continuity
and identity in the process of change and thereby denies the view
of annihilationism; if we misunderstand the nature of this iden-
tity, however, we fall into the trap of eternalism. (2) By indic-
ating how various different phenomena condition each other,
dependent arising also shows that there is difference and divers-
ity involved in the process of something changing, and thereby
denies the view of eternalism; but when this aspect of dependent
arising is not correctly grasped, we are drawn to the view of anni-
hilationism. (3) By indicating that actions are to be understood
not as the work of an autonomous self but rather as the-outcome
of the complex interaction of diverse impersonal conditions, the
view of selfhood is denied; but an incorrect grasp of this aspect
of the teaching can lead to the view that actions are not real
and have no moral consequences. (4) Finally, by indicating that
appropriate consequences follow from specific causes, both the
view that actions are not real and the view that causality is not
real are abandoned; but wrongly grasped this aspect of dependent
arising can lead both to the view of determinism and the view
that causality is not real. In all this, then, views that see the world
as random chaos, or as mechanically determined, or see individuals
as having absolute free will or as having no choice whatsoever and
simply being prey to random conditions or fixed destiny, are under-
stood as cut through by the middle way of dependent arising.

All this may sound very conceptual, abstract, and philosophical
but it is related rather precisely to the Buddhist understanding
of spiritual practice. For there is one more aspect of the teach-
ing of dependent arising that I have so far left unmentioned. The
twelvefold formula I quoted above is in accordance with the aris-
ing of suffering, but when the formula is quoted in Buddhist texts
it is nearly always quoted with a second version in the order of
the ceasing of suffering:

With the utter fading away and ceasing of ignorance is the ceasing of
formations, with the ceasing of formations is the ceasing of conscious-
ness, with the ceasing of consciousness is the ceasing of mind-and-body,
with the ceasing of mind-and-body is the ceasing of the six senses, with

No Self 157

the ceasing of the six senses is the ceasing of sense-contact, with the
ceasing of sense-contact is the ceasing of feeling, with the ceasing of feel-
ing is the ceasing of craving, with the ceasing of craving is the ceasing
of grasping, with the ceasing of grasping is the ceasing of becoming, with
the ceasing of becoming is the ceasing of birth, with the ceasing of birth
is the ceasing of old age and death—grief, lamentation, pain, sorrow and
despair cease. Thus is the ceasing of this entire mass of suffering.

Thus not only does dependent arising hold the key to the way in
which beings become enmeshed in suffering, it also points to the
way in which they can free themselves from suffering. Precisely
because all things occur in accordance with the law of dependent
arising, small changes in the nature of the conditions that con-
stitute the process can produce different effects. And because
the mind contains the seeds of wholesome action—namely non-
attachment, friendliness, and wisdom—as well as of unwhole-
some action, the root causes of suffering—namely ignorance
and craving—can be gradually undermined and eradicated. It is
because selfhood or personal continuity resides in the causal
conditioning that is circumscribed by dependent arising that we
can change, that we can bring about the cessation of suffering.
Indeed, if I were an unchanging ‘self’, what would be the point
of trying to change myself? The spiritual life would be meaningless.
The work of Buddhist practice then is quite simply to cultivate
those conditions that set in motion and bring about the process
of the ceasing of ignorance leading to the ceasing of suffering.
A significant ancient variation on the formula of dependent aris-
ing, having detailed the standard sequence of conditions lead-
ing to the arising of this whole mass of suffering, thus goes on to
state that:

Conditioned by (1) suffering, there is (2) faith, conditioned by faith, there
is (3) gladness, conditioned by gladness, there is (4) joy, conditioned
by joy, there is (5) tranquillity, conditioned by tranquillity, there is (6)
happiness, conditioned by happiness, there is (7) concentration, condi-
tioned by concentration, there is (8) knowledge and vision of what truly
is, conditioned by knowledge and vision of what truly is, there is (9) dis-
enchantment, conditioned by disenchantment, there is (10) dispassion,
conditioned by dispassion, there is (11) freedom, conditioned by free-
dom, there is (12) knowledge that the defilements are destroyed.”

Ficure 1. The Tibetan ‘Wheel of Existence’

No Self 159

This version of the formula introduces some of the technical
terminology of Buddhist meditation which will be discussed in
the next chapter. But what we must understand here is that Bud-
dhist thought envisages that there are essentially two currents of
the mind, one leading towards the arising of suffering, and one
leading towards its cessation; both function according to the pro-
cess of dependent arising, since this describes the way things are,
whether or not there is any buddha or Buddhist teaching in the
world to draw it to our attention. The law of dependent arising
is the way things are, it is Dharma—even when there is no bud-
dha in the world to point this out.”

The chain of dependent arising is sometimes referred to in
Buddhist texts as ‘the wheel of becoming’ (bhava-cakra/-cakka).
There is an old tradition of representing this graphically. Indeed,
instructions for this are included in the Milasarvastivadin Vinaya,
although nowadays the tradition is continued only in Tibetan
Buddhism (see Figure 1).“* The wheel itself is shown clutched in
the hands and jaws of Yama, the god of death. The outer circle
shows the twelve links: a blind man (ignorance), a potter fash-
ioning a pot (formations), a monkey picking a fruit (conscious-
ness), a boat on a journey (mind and body), a house with six
windows (the six sense-spheres), a couple embracing (sense con-
tact), a man struck in the eye by an arrow (feeling), a man drink-
ing (thirst), a man taking hold of a fruit (grasping), a pregnant
woman (becoming), a woman in labour (birth), a man carrying
a corpse to a charnel ground (old age and death). The next cir-
cle in shows six basic realms of rebirth: at the top, the heavenly
realms of the gods, moving clockwise, the jealous gods, animals,
hells, hungry ghosts, and humans. Moving inwards again we see
beings rising (on the left) and falling (on the right). At the hub,
driving the whole process, are a cock (greed), a snake (hatred)
and a pig (ignorance).

Did the Buddha deny the existence of the self?

Ihave been discussing just what is involved in the Buddhist denial
of the self, and some of the possible philosophical difficulties that

160 No Self

arise from conceiving of persons in terms of sequences of caus-
ally connected physical and mental events rather than enduring
substances. As I have indicated, the philosophical and concep-
tual elaboration of the teaching of no self in conjunction with
that of dependent arising is one of the hallmarks of Buddhist
thought. But the view that the teaching of no self annihilates the
individual and with it the basis of morality has been a feature
of the work of a number of nineteenth- and twentieth-century
scholars of Buddhism. Some of these accept the conclusion that
the teaching of the Buddha is thus irredeemably nihilistic. Others
have argued that the Buddhist elaboration of the teaching of no
self is the work of later scholastics who have misunderstood what
the Buddha actually taught.* Such scholars generally proceed by
pointing to the fact that in the earliest texts the Buddha certainly
uses the term ‘self’ and at the same time fails to deny categoric-
ally the existence of the self. Much in the manner of certain
Upanisadic teachers, the Buddha is merely represented as stating
what is not the self. Thus, it is claimed, when the aggregates are
said not to be self, only the things that constitute our ordinary
experience are denied as self; the door is left open for a metaphys-
ical, absolute self that underlies or is beyond those experiences
—the mysterious, ungraspable atman of the Upanisads. The argu-
ment here is that, as a pragmatic teacher, either the Buddha was
an agnostic as far as a metaphysical self was concerned, or he
did indeed accept its existence but wished to avoid becoming in-
volved in unnecessary speculations concerning its ultimate nature.

The point that the Buddha uses the term ‘self’ in the earliest
texts has in effect already been dealt with above since it is to be
referred to the distinction between conventional and ultimate truth.
Moreover, it should be noted in this connection that the word
Gtman is used in Sanskrit as an ordinary reflexive pronoun: thus
if one wants to say, ‘he threw himself into the river’ in Sanskrit,
one says that he threw his atman into the river without any sug-
gestion that it is his eternal and immortal soul that has been thrown
into the river.

The point that the Buddha fails to deny the self, but only states
what it is not, is more interesting. In one particular passage of

No Self 161

the Nikayas we are told how the Buddha was once asked by the
wanderer Vacchagotta whether the self existed.“ The Buddha
remained silent. Vacchagotta asked whether the self did not
then exist. The Buddha once again remained silent. The Buddha
then explained to the curious Ananda that if he had answered
that the self exists it would have been to side with those ascetics
and brahmins who hold the doctrine of ‘eternalism’; moreover
it would not have been in accordance with his understanding
that all phenomena (dharma) are not self. On the other hand if
he had answered that the self does not exist it would have been
to side with those ascetics and brahmins who hold the doctrine
of ‘annihilationism’; moreover it would have thrown poor Vac-
chagotta into even more confusion, as he would have concluded
that formerly he had a self but now he did not.

Essentially this refusal to answer Vacchagotta categorically
must be seen in the same light as the refusal to give unequivocal
answers to the ten undetermined questions; that is, the terms in
which the question is couched are not accepted. Furthermore,
we should note that, while the Buddha may refuse to give a cat-
egorical answer when asked whether or not the self exists, he is
nevertheless recorded as stating that all those ascetics and brah-
mins who contemplate the self in various ways in fact contem-
plate the five aggregates or one of them, and on the basis of this
come to the conclusion, ‘I exist’.“” This makes it clear, I think,
that to talk of a self that exists apart from the five aggregates is
meaningless for the Buddha. Thus the Buddha’s silence here is
not about leaving the door open for some mysterious, ungrasp-
able absolute self. The Buddha’s suggestion to Ananda that if he
had told Vacchagotta that the self does not exist he would have
become even more confused is revealing.

What is at issue here is not so much the question of the exist-
ence or non-existence of the self, but that in seeking to answer
the question of its existence the ordinary unawakened mind that
is not free from grasping inevitably gets entangled in views and
theories about the self. As we have seen, the awakened mind,
on the other hand, breaks free from all views about the self. Part
of the problem here stems from a failure on the part of some

162 No Self

modern scholars to appreciate the relationship between the
intellectual (cognitive) and emotional (affective) dimensions of
the teaching of no self. From the Buddhist perspective, the mind
needs to give up all attachment to any view about the self. That
is, to think ‘I do not exist’ reveals no less preoccupation and entan-
glement with the notion of my self and its existence than to think
‘I exist’. Buddhist thought is thus concerned with both our con-
scious intellectual theories about our ‘selves’ and also the way
in which our minds and emotions cling to the idea of our indi-
vidual existence at a subconscious level. This is well illustrated
by the story of the monk Khemaka who informs a group of monks
that, although he does not view any one of the aggregates as the
self, yet the idea of his own existence in the subtle form of the
‘the conceit “I am”’ clings to the aggregates as a faint smell of
dirt might still cling to washed clothes.

The Buddhist Path
The Way of Calm and Insight

Introductory remarks

The previous two chapters have focused on the Buddhist under-
standing of the nature of the world and of the individual; we have
seen how Buddhist thought sees the world of our experience
as constructed in dependence upon a variety of conditions, the
most crucial of which are greed, hatred, and delusion. The dis-
cussion of cosmology, the self, and dependent arising in effect
represents an elaboration of the first and second of the four noble
truths, namely suffering and its arising. This discussion has at times
touched on quite technical areas of Buddhist intellectual theory.
We come now to the fourth truth, the path leading to the cessa-
tion of suffering, the practice of Buddhism. In this connection
also, Buddhist tradition provides us with rather elaborate theor-
etical accounts, this time focusing on the stages of the path. There
is sometimes the idea in the West that Buddhism is an overly
philosophical and intellectual religion, but we should be careful
not to mistake Buddhism’s intellectual theories for Buddhism
itself—just as we should not confuse learning to swim with gain-
ing an understanding of the theory of buoyancy and propulsion,
or being able to play a musical instrument with an exact the-
oretical knowledge of where one has to put one’s fingers on a
fretboard or keyboard to produce a certain melody. Such theor-
etical knowledge may be useful in the process of learning, but the
experience of practice is never quite what one’s understanding
of theory leads one to expect.

Buddhist theory is, then, the soil in which understanding may
grow.' It should, moreover, be considered as intended more for
the benefit of monks or committed lay followers, who already

164 The Buddhist Path

have some basis in ordinary, everyday Buddhist practice, than
for the beginner. The vast majority of Buddhists today, as in the
past, do not concern themselves with intellectual theory but with
basic Buddhist practice. There are, furthermore, traditions in
Buddhism that are somewhat critical of theory, suggesting that
too much at the wrong time may clutter our minds and actually
get in the way of the practice that can eradicate attachment and
bring true wisdom. With this in mind let us turn to the theoret-
ical account of the path that leads to the cessation of suffering.

As we saw in Chapter 3 (pp. 81-2), in the earliest Buddhist texts
the noble truth of the path to the cessation of suffering is most
frequently summed up as the noble eightfold path: right view,
right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right
effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. But rather
than presenting it as equivalent to Buddhist practice in general,
Buddhist writings usually understand the noble eightfold path in
amore restricted sense, implied by the epithet ‘noble’ (arya/ariya).
The term indicates that one who has established these eight
qualities has in fact found the way to the cessation of suffering—
like one finding a path in the jungle leading to a beautiful city.
But the ‘ordinary man’ (prthagjana/puthujjana) who is plagued
by greed, hatred, and delusion cannot simply call into being the
right view of such ‘noble ones’ (a@rya/ariya) who have found the
path. He cannot, as it were, simply open the door and set out on
the noble eightfold path, first he must negotiate the jungle of his
views, behaviour, and emotions in order to find the eight qual-
ities. Much of the Buddhist path is thus concerned not so much
with walking the noble eightfold path as with finding the noble
eightfold path. The Buddhist practitioner thus sets out on the
ordinary path of Buddhist practice in order gradually to transform
view, intention, speech, action, endeavour, mindfulness, and con-
centration into the eight qualities of the noble path; once on the
noble path he may further develop and perfect these eight qual-
ities and follow the path to the complete cessation of suffering.

It is the structure of the ‘the step-by-step discourse’ (anupurvika
katha/anupubbi-katha), rather than the eightfold path, that informs

The Buddhist Path 165

the general accounts of the Buddhist path as a gradual progres-
sion from the fundamental practices of generosity (dana) and con-
duct (sila/sila), to the cultivation of concentration (samadhi) and
wisdom (prajfa/pafna) by means of meditative development
(bhavana) (see above, pp. 83-4). The often repeated step-by-step
discourse represents perhaps the most succinct statement of this
gradual path in the Nikayas/Agamas. An equally early but fuller
expression is found in the schema of ‘the fruits of asceticism’
(Sramanya-phala/samaniia-phala), an essentially stock account of
the path, which is again repeated with slight variations in a num-
ber of places in the Nikayas/Agamas. This schema is assumed and,
in one way or another, adapted by the later manuals such as the
Visuddhimagga, the Abhidharmako§a, Kamalasila’s Bhavanakrama
(‘Stages of Meditation’, eighth century) and also Chinese and later
Tibetan works such as Chih-i’s Mo-ho chih-kuan (‘Great Calm and
Insight’) and Hsiu-hsi chih-kuan tso-ch’an fa-yao (‘The Essentials
for Sitting in Meditation and Cultivating Calm and Insight’,
sixth century), sGam-po-pa’s Thar-pa rin-po-che’i rgyan (‘Jewel
Ornament of Liberation’, twelfth century) and Tsong-kha-pa’s
Lam rim chen mo (‘Great Graduated Path’, fourteenth century).
It is within this basic framework that I shall set out Buddhist prac-
tice. I will be referring to the details as set out by Buddhaghosa
in his Visuddhimagga and Vasubandhu in his AbhidharmakoSa,
since both these accounts acquired a certain authority for those
that followed. It must be emphasized, however, that the Bud-
dhist meditation tradition is extremely rich, and the material I
am presenting embodies a tradition of creative adaptation that
continues down to the present day. Important approaches to the
practice of Buddhist meditation that I am forced to pass over
include Ch’an (Japanese Zen) and esoteric systems of Tibetan
tantra, Chinese Chen Yen (Japanese Shingon), and the less well-
known esoteric Theravada tradition (see Chapter 10).

The role of faith

While the noble eightfold path may be understood as strictly
relevant only to the practice of the ‘noble ones’, nevertheless its

166 The Buddhist Path

basic structure can still be seen as revealing something general
about the nature of the spiritual path: the basic dependence
of one’s actions (items 3-5) upon one’s beliefs and aspirations
(items 1-2), and, in turn, of one’s basic emotional state (items
6-8) upon one’s actions. In fact here is a certain parallelism
between the structure of the eightfold path and the chain of
dependent arising, where ignorance conditions certain actions
which in turn condition one’s rebirth. The parallelism is clearer
when, as often in the early texts, we find talk of wrong view, wrong
intention, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong
endeavour, wrong mindfulness, wrong concentration. Moreover,
as the positive sequence of dependent arising begins with faith
(Sraddha/saddha), so the sequence of the eightfold path begins
with right view (samyag-drsti/samma-ditthi). Without some ini-
tial trust in the fact that there is a way out of suffering, without
some seed of understanding of the nature of suffering and its ces-
sation, we would never begin to look for the path and we would
have no hope of finding it.

An ancient formula describes the beginning of the path in the
following terms:

A Tathagata appears in the world... He teaches the Dharma that is
beautiful in the beginning, beautiful in the middle, and beautiful in the
end. A householder or a householder’s son or someone born into some
family hears that Dharma. And hearing the Dharma, he gains faith in
the Tathagata.”

Faith or confidence in the Buddha, his teaching (dharma/dhamma)
and the community (sangha) of those who have followed and real-
ized the teaching is the starting point of the Buddhist path that
is assumed both by the earliest texts and by those brought up
in traditional Buddhist cultures today. Yet those of us whose
sensibilities have been moulded by more recent Western intel-
lectual traditions are often uncomfortable in the presence of
religious faith and its devotional and ritual expression. Indeed
nineteenth- and early twentieth-century enthusiasts have on occa-
sion presented Buddhism as the answer to the modern world’s
‘crisis of faith’: a religion devoid of belief in God and the saving

The Buddhist Path 167

power of rituals, whose truths are not accepted on the authority
of scripture, but verified by direct experience.

Certainly the Buddha counsels the Kalamas not to reject or
accept things because tradition, scripture, reasoning, logic, or
argument tells them to do so, nor out of respect for some ascetic,
but rather because of their own direct knowledge.’ Yet a preoc-
cupation with the Kalama Sutta as a repudiation of faith betrays
a misunderstanding of the very nature of faith and its devotional
and ritual expression in Buddhism. As the Buddhist scholar
Edward Conze has commented:

This sceptical age dwells anyway far too much on the intellectual side
of faith. Sraddha, the word we render as ‘faith’, is etymologically akin
to Latin cor, ‘the heart’, and faith is much more a matter of the heart
than the intellect.*

Conze’s comment highlights a distinction that is sometimes made
between faith as ‘cognitive’ and faith as ‘affective’. Faith in its
cognitive mode is a putative knowledge or awareness that amounts
to belief in propositions or statements of which one does not, or
cannot, have direct knowledge. Faith in its affective mode, on
the other hand, is a positive emotional response to someone or
something one has heard or read. The Buddhist understanding
of ‘faith’ is almost entirely affective. In other words, Buddhist
texts understand faith in the Buddha and Dharma not so much
as a matter of intellectual assent to certain propositions about
the world in the form of a Buddhist creed, as of a state of trust,
confidence, affection, and devotion inspired by the person of the
Buddha and his teachings—a confidence that there is indeed a
path leading to the cessation of suffering which has been walked
by the Buddha and his followers.

The traditional expression of one’s faith, one’s commitment
to the Buddhist path, is the act of going to the three ‘jewels’ of
the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha for refuge, realized by the
formal recitation of the threefold formula set out at the end of
Chapter I (see p. 34).° Going for refuge implies the adopting
of one of two broad approaches to Buddhist practice: the way of
the lay follower (updsaka) and the way of the ordained monk

168 The Buddhist Path

(bhiksu/bhikkhu) or nun (bhiksuni/bhikkhuni). In practice, the
strength of commitment of both may vary, but generally, of course,
the monastic way of life represents the ultimate commitment to
the religious life, the ultimate expression of faith. But for lay
follower and monastic alike, the three ‘jewels’ remain powerful
objects for the ritual and devotional expression of their faith.
The precise form the earliest devotions took is unclear, but
they centred around the worship of stiipas. Thus the Buddha
himself is presented as recommending that faithful monks, nuns,
laymen, and laywomen visit the four sites where he was born,
gained awakening, first taught Dharma, and died; he adds that any
one who dies with a serene heart in the course of making such
a pilgrimage will gain a good rebirth.° Given the Indian cultural
context, worship no doubt took a form not entirely dissimilar from
more contemporary Buddhist practice: the making of offerings
—especially of flowers, incense, and lamps—and the chanting of
verses and formulas as the basis for the recollection of the qual-
ities of the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.’ Early Buddhist art
is often described as ‘aniconic’ since it avoided representing the
Buddha in human form, using instead various symbols (an empty
seat beneath the tree of awakening or the wheel of Dharma),
but from the second century ce the Buddha image increasingly
became a focus for such devotions and meditations. Another
ancient ritual practice important for the subsequent history of
Buddhism and which seems to be witnessed already in the earliest
writings is the recitation of certain siitras as protective charms
(raksa/paritta).* The Vinaya describes monks circumambulating
a monastery and chanting to protect the Buddha when they
believe his life is threatened.’ One of the oldest such protective
chants is the Asandatiya Sutta, a charm to protect the monk medit-
ating in the forest from unsympathetic demons (yaksa/yakkha)."°
Alongside specific charms for the protection of women in child-
birth or the pacifying of dangerous snakes, for example, chanting
Buddhist texts and formulas, such as the refuges and precepts,
in general came to be regarded as effective in protecting one against
the dangers of disease and accident. The second- or first-century
BCE Milindapanha, while acknowledging the inability of such

The Buddhist Path 169

charms to give us absolute protection from the effects of our
bad karma, nevertheless defends their efficacy in certain circum-
stances." The different traditions of Buddhism in Sri Lanka and
South-East Asia, in East Asia, and in Tibet have all developed
their own distinctive forms of devotional and protective ritual,
yet these derive from a common ancient ancestry.

The Buddha of the early texts may be critical, then, of cer-
tain kinds of brahmanical ritual, especially those involving the
sacrifice of animals; he may also deny that faith and rituals can
of themselves bring about the final cessation of suffering. But
there is no real evidence in the early texts to suggest a negative
attitude to faith and its ritual and devotional expression; indeed
we even find the Buddha apparently approving of worship at
non-Buddhist shrines.’ Faith and the activities which express that
faith are, in fact, seen as performing a spiritually crucial function:
they soothe and settle the mind thereby arousing the confidence
to continue the practice of the path. Moreover, the mind that is
quietly confident and trustful of the power of the Buddha, Dharma,
and Sangha is its own protection. Two ancient images for faith
are worth noting. Faith is compared to a gem which, when thrown
into a stream that has just been stirred up by the passing of an
emperor’s army, immediately causes the sand, silt, and mud to settle.
Or if one were standing at the bank of a river in spate unable to
judge whether it might be possible to leap over it and someone
should come along and indeed jump across, then there might arise
the confidence that it is indeed possible to cross the torrent. So
faith has two characteristics: it causes the mind to become set-
tled and composed and it inspires it with the confidence to leap
forward.'3 In sum, devotional and ritual practice constitute a pre-
liminary meditation practice, settling and composing the mind in
preparation for the higher stages of Buddhist meditative practice.

Good conduct

I have already briefly discussed generosity and good conduct as
bases of ‘auspicious action’ or ‘merit’ (punya/pufia) above (see
pp. 101-2). In the present context I wish to comment further

170 The Buddhist Path

on the Buddhist understanding of ‘good conduct’ or ‘virtue
(Sila/sila). It is useful here to make a distinction between the good
conduct as the refraining from various deeds that are considered
unwholesome and harmful to both oneself and others, and the
perfected conduct of one who is awakened, such as a buddha
or arhat. The ordinary unawakened person sometimes acts in a
wholesome, sometimes in an unwholesome manner. The goal
of the Buddhist path is to eradicate the unwholesome motiva-
tions that cause harmful behaviour. To achieve this the mind
needs to be ‘trained’. Part of the training involves the undertak-
ing of various precepts, literally principles or bases of training
(Siksapada/sikkhapada), in order to try to restrain the mind and
draw it back from the grosser kinds of unwholesome behaviour.
For one who is awakened such precepts are redundant, not
because he or she is now permitted these kinds of behaviour, but
because conduct is now perfected and the temptation or rather
the motivation at the root of such kinds of behaviour has gone.
That is, the ordinary unawakened person’s actions are sometimes
motivated by greed, aversion, and delusion and sometimes by
non-attachment, friendliness, and wisdom. Since a buddha or arhat
has completely eradicated the defilements and any latent tendency
to attachment, aversion, or delusion, he or she acts exclusively
from non-attachment, friendliness, and wisdom.

As part of the practice of the path, it is traditional for the
lay follower to take on five precepts: to refrain from harming liv-
ing creatures, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct, false
speech, intoxicants that cause heedlessness. On occasion, for
limited periods, the committed lay follower may take on eight
precepts, while the monk’s good conduct is founded on ten basic
precepts elaborated in terms of the the 200 plus rules of the
pratimoksa (see Chapter 4); much of this elaboration in prin-
ciple involves distinguishing between serious and less serious
breaches of the ten precepts.

The five precepts are for the most part self-explanatory,
although there is a certain subtlety in their definition. The first pre-
cept is usually taken as specifically referring to killing, although
a wider definition is not excluded. The second refers in simple

>

The Buddhist Path I7I

terms to stealing, although once more the wider definition begs
the question of what precisely constitutes ‘what is not given’. The
third precept is traditionally taken as referring to sexual inter-
course with partners who are prohibited—in other words, adul-
tery; but again, the precept raises the question of what exactly
constitutes sexual misconduct (and even, since a literal transla-
tion of the expression might be ‘misconduct with regard to sen-
sual desire’, questions about more general sensual indulgence).
The fourth precept refers specifically to lying but the question
of right speech is elaborated upon in Buddhist texts (see below).
The fifth precept also has wider implications. Heedlessness is inter-
preted by Theravadin commentators as the absence of ‘mindful-
ness’ (smrti/sati), an important psychological quality. It is not the
taking of alcohol or other drugs as such that is problematic, but
the state of mind that it generally induces: a lack of mental clar-
ity with an increased tendency to break the other precepts. The
fifth precept also highlights once more that what we have to do
with here are ‘principles of training’ and what is of paramount
importance in the Buddhist conception of spiritual training is
mental clarity: this helps to create the conditions that conduce
to seeing the way things truly are. The additional precepts in the
lists of eight and ten are similarly principles of training seen as
helpful in the cultivation of the path, rather than prohibitions
against intrinsically unwholesome ways of conduct.

The kinds of behaviour that the five precepts are intended
to prevent one from committing are outlined by the list of ten
courses of unwholesome action: harming living creatures, taking
what is not given, sexual misconduct, false speech, divisive speech,
harsh speech, frivolous speech, covetousness, anger, wrong view
(see above, pp. 120-1). In these ten actions—three of body, four
of speech, and three of thought—we find speech further elabo-
rated, while the particular emphasis on actions of thought and
the mind draws attention once again to the Buddhist focus on
karma as essentially a matter of the mind and intention: what is
important is one’s state of mind, and a moment of intense anger
and hatred, even if it does not lead to actual physical violence
or verbal abuse, nevertheless constitutes a real ‘deed’ or karma.

172 The Buddhist Path

The five precepts and the ten courses of action essentially
define for us right speech and action of the eightfold path. What
of ‘right livelihood’, the third item of the eightfold path that bears
on good conduct? This is basically understood as making one’s
living by means that avoid activity infringing the five precepts.
Such occupations as that of the soldier, butcher, or trader in
alcohol are therefore called into question. Yet in approaching
questions of good conduct and the precepts, Buddhist tradition
has generally shown an attitude of practicality and flexibility.
In order to illustrate this it is worth briefly considering the ques-
tion of vegetarianism in the light of the first precept.

The ethical ideal that underlies the precepts is considered
to be rather exalted, such that only someone very advanced on
the path (a stream-attainer, or even a buddha or arhat) could
really live up to it. Indeed, good conduct is ultimately under-
stood in Buddhist thought not in terms of adherence to ex-
ternal rules, but as the expression of the perfected motivations
of non-attachment, friendliness, and wisdom. Thus the arhat is
described as simply being incapable of intentionally acting in a
manner that is not in accordance with the precepts and ten
courses of wholesome action.'* In other words, ordinary beings
cannot hope to keep the precepts perfectly; rather they abide by
the precepts as rules of training in order to curb the grosser forms
of bad conduct. At a deeper level there is also perhaps a sense
in which no one, not even a buddha, can hope to live in the world
and cause absolutely no harm to any living being. That is, it is
almost impossible to isolate and disassociate oneself absolutely
from activities that indirectly cause harm to living creatures.
That this is so is an aspect of the deepest level of the first noble
truth: the world, samsara, is by its very nature an imperfect
place, a place where suffering is always lurking in one form or
another. The question of acting ethically then becomes one of
where to draw the line.

In respect of harming living creatures Buddhist thought has
generally and in the first place drawn the line at direct and inten-
tional killing. Of course, this does not mean that harm that falls
short of killing is ethical, or that by only giving the order to kill

The Buddhist Path 173

one is free of blame. Yet there is no direct prescription against
the eating of meat in the earliest Buddhist texts. Buddhist monks
and nuns, who are dependent on what is offered to them, are
encouraged not to be too fussy and are permitted to accept meat
provided it has not been specifically slaughtered to feed them
(though certain kinds of flesh such as that of humans, snakes,
and horses are never allowable).!* On the other hand there is
also an ancient and widespread Buddhist attitude that regards
vegetarianism as the appropriate response to the first precept.
Although many Buddhists in traditional Buddhist cultures are
not strict vegetarians, eating no meat is respected as further-
ing the aspiration to live without harming living creatures that
underlies the first precept. The Mahayana Lankavatara Siitra
explicitly argues at length against meat-eating, and its outlook
has been influential especially in East Asian Buddhism, where
vegetarianism has often been the norm for members of the Bud-
dhist monastic community and committed lay followers.'°

But there is also in the Buddhist attitude to good conduct the
suggestion that adherence to ‘moral’ principles for their own sake
may be an expression of rigid views and attachment—‘clinging
to precepts and vows’ (Sila-vrata-paramarsa/sitla-bbata-paramasa)
—tather than of true compassion. Ultimately Buddhism teaches
that the nature of good conduct is subtle and complex—so com-
plex that it precisely cannot be solved by reference to precepts
and rules of conduct. It can only be solved by following a path
of training that ends in rooting out greed, aversion, and delu-
sion. Ethical precepts are a necessary part of the training that
constitutes that path, but attachment to those precepts, like all
attachments, must itself be given up.

As with faith, the practice of good conduct is once more ori-
entated towards meditation practice. An important aspect of medi-
tation practice is the stilling and calming of the mind. Apart from
the harm they cause to others, and the unpleasant results they
will bring upon us through the operation of the law of karma and
the process of rebirth, the ten courses of unwholesome action
are also seen as damaging to one’s own sense of well-being, result-
ing in feelings of guilt and remorse. At a subtler level they are

174 The Buddhist Path

seen as intrinsically disturbing. Keeping the precepts, on the other
hand, frees the mind from guilt and also has a strong protective
quality, warding off danger. Thus it is said that the one who abides
by the precepts ‘experiences a blameless happiness within’."” In
fact, as expressions of deep faith and trust in the Buddha’s teach-
ing, Buddhist devotional and ritual acts (going for refuge, taking
the precepts, chanting siitras, etc.) are generally seen as having
a protective quality, keeping the mind free of fear and warding
off danger.'® We have here an understanding that verges on the
magical.

The practice of calm meditation

Basic principles of Buddhist meditation

We come now to the subject of meditation and its role in the
Buddhist spiritual path. Curiously it is difficult to find a precise
equivalent of the term ‘meditation’ in Buddhist technical termi-
nology. The two principal candidates are bhavand and yoga. The
first of these is the older, specifically Buddhist term and means
literally ‘bringing into being’; it refers to mental or spiritual exer-
cises aimed at developing and cultivating wholesome mental
states that conduce to the realization of the Buddhist path. Such
exercises may centre on sitting quietly in a cross-legged posture,
but should not be reduced to that. The second term means
approximately ‘effort’ or ‘work’ and relatively early in the his-
tory of Indian religion came to refer to specifically spiritual work
and techniques. In this sense the term is one of very varied ap-
plication, there being many different approaches to yoga within
Indian tradition from those such as hatha-yoga which focus on
the practice of different bodily postures (dsana) to those such as
Buddhist yoga which focus on contemplative techniques while
sitting in some form of the cross-legged posture.

Buddhist tradition comes to consider meditation by way of two
different but complementary aspects, namely calm (Samatha/
samatha) and insight (vipasyana@/vipassana), which are geared to
the cultivation of deep states of concentration (samadhi) and

The Buddhist Path 175

wisdom (prajfia/panna) respectively. Some modern scholars have
seen these two kinds of meditation as reflecting tensions and even
disagreements within the earliest Buddhist tradition concerning
the nature of the Buddhist path. I shall return to this matter
presently. But, whatever their early history and origins, it is clear
that in developed Buddhist theory the two aspects of meditation,
calm and insight, are seen as together forming the basis for the
realization of the Buddhist goal: when calm and insight medita-
tion are brought together (yuga-naddha), the unconditioned may
be experienced.

According to a cardinal principle of Buddhist psychology our
minds are fundamentally clear and pure; they have become stained
by the operation of adventitious defilements (klesa/kilesa).

Radiant is the mind, monks, but sometimes it is defiled by defilements
that come from without. The ordinary man without understanding does
not know it as it truly is.'®

The goal of Buddhist practice is to bring to an end the operation
of these defilements. The basic method is to restore to the mind
something of its fundamental state of clarity and stillness. This
clarity of mind provides the opportunity for seeing into the op-
eration of the defilements and the mind’s true nature, for seeing
things as they really are, for fully awakening. The way of return-
ing the mind to its state of clarity is by the use of the techniques
of calm meditation, which can temporarily suppress or block the
immediate defilements that disturb the mind; the way of seeing
clearly into the nature of the mind is by the methods of insight
meditation, which, in association with calm, can finally eradicate
those defilements.

The way of Buddhist meditation is, then, to look deep into
ourselves to see the very nature of our minds. The principal
immediate mental defilements that constitute the obstacles to the
path are known as the five ‘hindrances’ (nivarana): sensual desire,
ill-will, tiredness and sleepiness, excitement and depression, and
doubt. An ancient simile compares the mind that is continually
prey to the five hindrances to a bowl of water disturbed or con-
taminated in five ways: mixed with red dye, steaming hot, full of

176 The Buddhist Path

moss and leaves, ruffled by the wind, muddied and in a dark place.
If someone should look down into a bowl of water contaminated
in any one of these five ways, then he would not be able to see
a clear and true reflection of himself. On the other hand, if one
were to look down into a bowl of water that is free of such con-
taminations, one would see a clear and true reflection. Likewise,
the mind that is disturbed by the hindrances will never succeed
in coming to know its true nature.

This then is the basic theory of Buddhist meditation stated in
the terms of the oldest texts. While later schools and traditions
may change and adapt the terminology used, while they may elab-
orate the stages and techniques in a number of different ways,
while they may give distinctive technical accounts of the content
of the knowledge gained in insight meditation, the basic prin-
ciple for the most part holds good: one stills and clears the mind
and then turns it towards investigation and insight.

Stilling the mind

The techniques of calm meditation involve counteracting the
tendency of the mind to restlessly seek out new and different
objects of the senses. This is accomplished by developing a basic
capacity of the mind to rest undisturbed on-an object of per-
ception. This capacity, termed ‘concentration’ (samadhi), is in
fact understood as a prerequisite of all thought, but in normal
consciousness it functions only minimally. When this capacity is
developed in meditation practice, however, it brings the mind to
a condition of stillness in which it finds complete contentment
with just one object of contemplation. In this condition the
mind enters into quite different states of consciousness from its
habitual, ordinary states. These states of consciousness may
themselves be termed samadhi, or alternatively they are known
as the dhydnas (Pali jhana), a term which means something like
‘deep thought’ or ‘meditation’. In Buddhist technical terms, the
mind has temporarily escaped from ‘the sphere of the senses’
(kamavacara)—its normal preoccupation with thoughts that are
in some way bound up with the objects of the five senses—to the
subtle ‘sphere of pure form’ (ripavacara)—a refined world of

The Buddhist Path 177

pure, abstract ‘forms’ (riipa). The experience of this refined world
of pure form comprises four increasingly subtle dhyanas corres-
ponding to the sixteen Brahma realms of the Buddhist cosmos
(Chapter 5).

To begin to still the mind by the practice of calm meditation
one needs, then, a suitable object of contemplation. Drawing
on the earlier Nikayas/Agamas, later manuals such as Upatissa’s
Vimuttimagga (‘Path of Freedom’) and Buddhaghosa’s Visud-
dhimagga give standardized lists of thirty-eight and forty ob-
jects of meditation (kammatthana) respectively; Vasubandhu’s
AbhidharmakoSa focuses on a more limited number of medita-
tion objects. Upatissa and Buddhaghosa initially discuss the sub-
jects of meditation from two points of view: (1) their suitability
for the practice of the preliminary or advanced stages of calm
meditation, and (2) their suitability for different personality
types (see Table 4).”°

Certain objects—the six recollections (anusmrti/anussati) of the
Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha, good conduct, generosity,
and the gods, along with mindfulness of death—are suited to the
preliminary practice of calm known as ‘access concentration’
(upacara-samadhi), which is a level of concentration considered
to be on the brink of full dhyana or ‘absorption’ (appana). Others
—the ten ‘devices’ (kasina), along with mindfulness of breath-
ing (G@napana-smrti/-sati)—are suitable for both the preliminary
and more advanced stages. Yet others, such as the four ‘form-
less’ (ariipa) meditations, can only be cultivated by the advanced
practitioner of calm. Certain meditation subjects are also tra-
ditionally regarded as particularly suited to different character
types. Thus someone with a strong tendency towards sensual desire
should balance this by cultivating the ten meditations on ‘ugliness’
(asubha/asubha), that is, on the body in ten different degrees of
putrefaction; someone with strong faith will respond to the first
six recollections; while for someone with a tendency to intel-
lectualize and get lost in speculations, mindfulness of breathing
is particularly recommended as cutting off discursive thinking;
someone whose temperament is irritable and who tends towards
states of anger and hatred might take one of the four coloured

discs as a meditation subject. Upatissa and Buddhaghosa go into
some detail concerning the analysis of different character types
and how the way one carries out various tasks (how one eats or
walks, for example) reveals the tendencies of one’s personality.
In this connection, they also emphasize the need for a medita-
tion teacher—the good friend (kalyana-mitra/-mitta)—who can
suggest and teach a suitable meditation subject. The importance
of the teacher is, of course, one of the great themes of Buddhist
practice. The teacher of meditation stands in the place of the
Buddha himself and, just as one should have faith and trust in
the Buddha and his teachings, so one must have faith and trust
in the meditation teacher and his instructions; without such faith
it is impossible to put the teacher’s instructions into practice with
the necessary sense of commitment. Thus kneeling before one’s
teacher and paying him appropriate respect are recommended
as generating faith.

It is sometimes suggested in scholarly studies that ‘medita-
tion’ is traditionally the preserve of a minority and élite. group
of Buddhist monastics.”1 Obviously the question of which Bud-
dhists ‘meditate’ depends on how one defines ‘meditation’. As
I suggested above, it is not entirely clear which Buddhist tech-
nical term the English word ‘meditation’ corresponds to. But it
is clear that much of ordinary, everyday Buddhist devotional prac-
tice takes the form of some kind of recollection of the Buddha,
Dharma, and Sangha, and also the other recollections of good con-
duct, generosity, and the gods.” For Upatissa and Buddhaghosa
such recollection practice constitutes the preliminary stage of
calm meditation. There is, then, a real sense in which nearly all
Buddhists—lay or monastic—can be considered ‘meditators’. Even
if the term bhavana is taken to imply the systematic cultivation
of a particular meditation subject, the line between Buddhist devo-
tions and formal, systematic meditation is not sharp. Devotions
arouse faith and compose the mind; to this extent they form a
preliminary stage of calm meditation, settling the mind in a state
close to dhyana, technically termed ‘access concentration’. To fully
develop calm, however, one must cultivate a further subject of
meditation.

180 The Buddhist Path

The hindrances and the limbs of dhyana

The basic instructions for beginning meditation are very simple.
One finds a quiet place and sits down in a cross-legged position
and arousing the appropriate motivation one gently places the
mind’s attention on whatever is the particular object of medita-
tion. Inevitably the meditator finds that his or her mind wanders
and the attention must be repeatedly brought back to the object
of meditation. The reason the mind fails to become absorbed in
the object of meditation is twofold. On the one hand, the mind
is prey to the five hindrances already mentioned. On the other
hand, it has not developed sufficient skill in bringing the object
to mind or, in technical terminology, the five ‘limbs’ of dhyana
are not sufficiently strong.

In principle, something of the process of overcoming the hind-
rances and developing the factors of dhyana can be observed
whenever the mind is applied to any new task that requires a
certain mental application and dexterity. Take the example of
learning to play a musical instrument. In order to progress one
needs to practise regularly and patiently. Almost inevitably, at
times other less taxing activities seem much more attractive
and pleasurable than struggling with one’s practice. This is the
first hindrance of desire for the objects of the senses. At times
one may become frustrated, irritated, and angry, seeing faults in
one’s musical instrument or teacher, or using the fact the neigh-
bours are making too much noise as a reason for not persever-
ing with one’s practice. This is the second hindrance of ill will.
Or the very thought of one’s practice may make one feel tired
and drowsy, yet when one thinks of doing something else that
the mind finds more interesting, suddenly one feels wide awake
and alert. This is the third hindrance of tiredness and sleepiness.
Or one may suddenly become over-excited at one’s progress,
or depressed at what one sees as one’s lack of progress. This
is the fourth hindrance of excitement and depression. Finally
one may doubt the whole enterprise, asking oneself what the
point is in learning to play a musical instrument anyway. Just
as anyone wishing to make progress in the learning of a musical

The Buddhist Path 181

instrument must acquire some measure of control over such
hindrances, so the meditator intent on developing his meditation
subject must deal with these immediate defilements of the mind.

Again, at the outset of learning to play the guitar or piano, the
beginner must very consciously think where to put each individual
finger. At the same time one must begin to pay attention to the
subtler aspects of just how one places a finger on a key or plucks
a string; one must pay attention to the subtle differences this
gives to the quality and length of a note. These two aspects of
paying attention to an object of consciousness are referred to
in Buddhist psychology as vitarka/vitakka and vicara, which can
be rendered very approximately as ‘application of thought’ and
‘examining’; these are the first two of the five limbs of dhyana.
When these two aspects of thinking are developed in the con-
text of a particular skill we are trying to learn, a certain kind of
quickening occurs: suddenly the mind is enlivened by its facility
in the task at hand and begins to take pleasure in it; in con-
sequence it begins to feel more at ease and content. This is the
arising of the next two limbs of dhyana, joy (priti/piti) and happi-
ness (sukha). And as the mind feels happy and content it becomes
less distracted and more absorbed in whatever it is doing. This
is the arising of the fifth limb of dhydna, namely ‘one-pointedness
of the mind’ (cittaikagrata/cittass’ekaggata) which is another term
for ‘concentration’ or ‘collectedness’ (samadhi) itself. In the case
of meditation practice, the mind ceases to seek out new objects
of consciousness and becomes unified, resting on one object of
consciousness without any tendency to move.

The signs and the stages of joy

The overcoming of the five hindrances and the coming into
balance of these five limbs of dhydna is, according to the later
manuals, equivalent to the mind becoming settled in ‘access’
concentration, a state of mind on the threshold of dhyana.” The
manuals describe the stages leading to access concentration in
two different ways (see Table 5). In effect, Upatissa and Bud-
dhaghosa give an account in terms of three successive mental
images or ‘signs’ (nimitta) and five stages of joy (piti), while Asanga

and Vasubandhu, the fathers of the Yogacara tradition of
Mahayana thought, detail nine stages of the settling of the mind
(citta-sthiti), although they too make reference to the mental images
(pratibimba) seen in meditation. I will not go into the details of
the latter account here, but it has come to have great authority
for Tibetan manuals of meditation.”

The concept of the nimitta is most easily explained with ref-
erence to meditation on the coloured disks. To undertake this
kind of meditation the meditator should first prepare a disk of
the appropriate colour. He should then set it up in front of him
and, sitting down, begin to try to place his attention on the disk.
The ‘initial’ or ‘preparatory sign’ (parikamma-nimitta) is the
gross physical object. After some practice, the meditator will no
longer need the actual physical object to contemplate, but will
be able to visualize the object in his mind directly; the object of
meditation is now the ‘acquired sign’ (uggaha-nimitta). As the

The Buddhist Path 183

meditator investigates and explores the acquired sign, there even-
tually arises the ‘counterpart sign’ (patibhaga-nimitta). The aris-
ing of the counterpart sign is concurrent with the attainment
of access concentration. Whereas the acquired sign is a mental
visualization of the physical object exactly as it appears—an
eidetic image—the counterpart sign is a purified conceptual image
free of any marks or blemishes. In the case of, say, the white or
red disk the mind becomes completely absorbed in the concept
of ‘whiteness’ or ‘redness’. The arising of the counterpart sign is
compared to the moon coming out from behind clouds.

I have already mentioned how, as the mind becomes fam-
iliar with the object of meditation, it is enlivened and begins to
feel more at ease. The stages of this process are charted rather
exactly in the list of the five kinds of joy. Thus the initial stage
of ‘slight joy’ simply raises the hairs of the body; ‘momentary
joy’ comes like repeated flashes of lightning, while ‘descending
joy’ is stronger and washes over the body again and again and
then subsides; ‘transporting joy’ has the power to lift the body
into the air. A Thai meditation manual written at the turn of the
last century describes it as follows:

When transporting joy arises it is very strong; it makes the whole body
shake and tremble. The meditator will fall to the left or to the right,
bow down, clap hands and feet, sit down, stand up, and then run around
filled with strange emotions. The meditators will cry and laugh and will
not be able to shut their eyes or mouths. The veins will protrude and
the blood feel hot and cold. The body will feel as if it is expanding and
will levitate the length of a finger span, a cubit, an arm’s length.

We are counselled that such phenomena are not a sign of mad-
ness. Rather they indicate the progress of one’s meditation prac-
tice. Eventually, the mind settles in ‘suffusing joy’; this kind of
joy pervades the whole body touching every part and is likened
to water flooding into a rock cave. The spiritual (niramisa) joy felt
in meditation is contrasted by the tradition with carnal (sdmisa)
joy. The point here seems not so much to suggest sexual pleasure
as a mere metaphor for spiritual joy, but rather to indicate that
the increasing joy experienced as the mind gradually becomes

184 The Buddhist Path

settled and calm in meditation parallels in a real sense the stages
of sexual excitement and enjoyment. Indeed, it is in such terms
that some contemporary Buddhist monks describe their medita-
tion experience.” The kinds of joy and ‘signs’ are in fact indic-
ative of the variety of visual and physical phenomena that may
accompany meditation.”’ Such phenomena seem to be something
of a universal in the experience and lives of contemplatives from
whatever religious tradition.

With the suppression of the five hindrances and the arising of
the counterpart sign, or, in Asanga’s terms, with the attainment
of the ninth stage of the settling of the mind, consciousness
reaches the relative peace and quiet and clarity of ‘access con-
centration’. This is distinguished from absorption or dhyana
proper by virtue of the fact that, although fully present, the five
limbs of dhyana are weak and unstable and liable to fail the med-
itator who will then fall from the state of concentration rather
like a child who takes his first tentative steps and then falls in a
heap. With practice the meditator achieves skill in absorption.
The most ancient description of this process is as follows:

Abandoning these five hindrances which are defilements of the mind
and weaken understanding, quite secluded from the objects of sense-
desire and unwholesome states, he attains the first jhdna, a state of joy
and happiness born of seclusion and accompanied by application of
thought and examining. He soaks, pervades, fills and suffuses this very
body with that joy and happiness born of seclusion such that there is no
part of his whole body that is not suffused by that joy and happiness
born of seclusion. It is as if a skilled bath attendant or his apprentice,
having sprinkled bath-powder onto a bronze tray, were to knead it together
evenly with drops of water such that the ball of bath-powder is covered
and filled with moisture, is suffused with moisture within and without,
and yet does not drip.*

The stages of dhyana

The initial attainment of meditative absorption or dhydna is
characterized by the presence and balancing of five mental qual-
ities, the limbs of dhyana. But this initial attainment can be fur-
ther refined. The process of refinement seems once again best

The Buddhist Path 185

understood by reference to some such process as that of learning
to play a musical instrument. In the initial stage of competence
the mind will still have to pay attention in the way described
above: it will have to think consciously what to do. However, as
one’s facility develops the process will become increasingly auto-
matic and unconscious—that is, the concert pianist does not
have to think consciously where to put his hands or how to place
her fingers, she just does it; nevertheless he is still fully aware
of what he is doing. In much the same way, it seems, the med-
itator becomes able to attain states of concentration by simply
adverting to the object of meditation. Attaining to states of con-
centration in this way without ‘application of thought’ or ‘exam-
ining’ is the characteristic of the second dhyana, which thus has
only three remaining limbs of dhyana: joy, happiness, and one-
pointedness of mind. From here the state of concentration can
be further refined. Joy is experienced as something that in itself
can disturb the mind. With the subsiding of joy one attains the
third dhyana. In a similar manner the meditator eventually lets
go of happiness too, and finally attains the fourth dhyana, a state
of purified equanimity and balance.

The fourth dhyana represents something of a turning point in
the theory of the Buddhist path. In attaining the fourth dhyana
the process of stilling and calming the mind is essentially com-
plete. Although the theory allows for the further refining and
stilling of the mind in the meditative attainments known as the
four formless (aripa) attainments, these are presented as essen-
tially modifications and refinements of the fourth dhyana.”
The fourth dhyana also forms the basis for the development of
various meditational powers: the rddhis (Pali iddhi) or ‘higher
knowledges’ (abhijna/abhinna). The meditator is able to produce
‘mind-made’ bodies:

Being one he becomes many, being many he becomes one; unhindered
he passes into... an invisible state, through house-walls, through city-
walls, and through mountains, as if through space; he goes down into
the earth and comes up, as if through water; he goes over firm water,
as if over earth; he travels through the sky cross-legged, as if he were
a bird with wings; he touches and strokes with his hand the sun and

186 The Buddhist Path

the moon...he has mastery with his body as far as the world of
Brahma.

Or he has knowledge of distant sounds, knowledge of the state
of others’ minds, knowledge of his own and others’ past lives.*°

The place of the various meditational powers in Buddhist
practice is a question of some dispute.*! Sometimes it is suggested
by scholars that these powers are regarded as entirely peripheral
and even disparaged in the earliest texts. There is no real evid-
ence for such a view. In fact, although it is quite true that both
the earliest texts and the later manuals do not present the medi-
tational powers as an essential or necessary part of Buddhist
practice, they nevertheless regard them as useful complements
to the meditator’s practice that may facilitate his practice of the
higher stages of the path. More significantly, with the attainment
of the final goal of awakening, skill in the meditational powers
becomes a means for teaching and helping others. We thus find
stories of the Buddha and his awakened disciples using their
ability in meditational powers to aid others in the practice of the
path. In other contexts they are simply presented as a natural
by-product or consequence of the practice of calm meditation.
Stories of such meditational powers are everywhere part of the
Buddhist tradition; they are told of the tantric siddhas of Tibet,
(see Chapter 10) and of the modern saints and practitioners of
South-East Asia.”

The brahma-viharas

One group of ancient meditation practices that the Theravadin
meditation manuals accommodate to the scheme of dhydnas
(but which it has been suggested were originally conceived as
a path to complete awakening in their own right) are the four
‘immeasurables’ (apramdna/appamafina) or ‘divine abidings’
(brahma-viharas).*> The underlying motivation for the practice
of the Buddhist path is generally understood to be the bene-
fit and welfare of both oneself and others. Thus according to
Theravadin Abhidharma the wholesome mind always contains
the seed of ‘loving kindness’ (maitri/metta). It is this seed that

The Buddhist Path 187

can be taken as a subject of meditation and developed as a
‘divine abiding’. Loving kindness is understood as the wish for all
beings—oneself and others—to be well and happy. It is likened
to the feelings of a mother towards her child. Loving kindness is
the basis of the second ‘divine abiding’, compassion (karunda),
which is the wish for the suffering of all beings to cease, and is
likened to the feelings of a mother towards her sick child. The
third divine abiding is ‘sympathetic joy’ (mudita), the delight in
the good fortune of others and the wish for it to continue; this
is likened to the feelings of a mother at her child’s successes. The
final divine abiding is ‘equanimity’ (upeksa@/upekkha), a state
of calm balance with regard to the sufferings and pleasures of
beings; it is likened to the attitude of a mother to a child that is
busy with its own affairs, indicating that equanimity should not
be misunderstood as mere indifference.™

The four divine abidings are described as being developed by
beginning with the wish for one’s own well-being and happiness;
this feeling is then gradually extended—through a dwelling, a town,
across a country—to other beings, until the meditator dwells per-
vading all directions with a mind that is imbued with loving kind-
ness and free from enmity.

The stages of insight meditation

With the essential work of calming the mind completed, with
the attainment of the fourth dhyana, the meditator can focus
fully on the development of insight and the wisdom that under-
stands the four truths. Insight meditation aims at understanding
three aspects of the nature of things: that they are impermanent
and unstable (anitya/anicca), that they are unsatisfactory and
imperfect (duhkha/dukkha), and that they are not self (anatman/
anatta). The philosophical nuances of these three terms may
be expressed differently in the theoretical writings of various
Buddhist schools, but in one way or another the higher stages of
the Buddhist path focus on the direct understanding and seeing
of these aspects of the world.

188 The Buddhist Path

The culmination of calm meditation is the attainment of a state
of calm where the mind rests in complete ease and contentment
—either access concentration or one of the four dhyanas; the
culmination of insight meditation is likewise a state of calm and
ease—one of the dhydnas or also (according to the Sarvastivadins)
the state of access concentration. But the difference is that in the
final stage of insight meditation the mind settles not with an abstract
concept as its object, but in the direct seeing of suffering, its cause,
its cessation, and the path leading to its cessation. There are thus
two varieties of concentration—one achieved solely as a re-
sult of calm meditation, the other achieved as a result of both
calm and insight meditation. The latter may be either ordinary
(laukika/lokiya) or transcendent (lokottara/lokuttara) depend-
ing on whether it involves a direct experience of nirvana or not.

The point at which a meditator actively turns to the contem-
plation of phenomena as impermanent, suffering, and not self is
not fixed either for the ancient manuals or in modern practice.
The theoretical models of the paths set out in the classical man-
uals of Upatissa, Buddhaghosa, and Vasubandhu accommodate
two basic approaches: one in which the meditator practises the
dhyanas fully before turning to the development of insight and
one in which the meditator attempts to cultivate insight with only
a minimal basis of calm.

Just as the manuals provide various schemata for the stages of
calm meditation, so also they provide different accounts of the
stages of insight meditation. After Buddhaghosa, the Theravadin
tradition works primarily with a system of seven ‘purifications’
(visuddhi) alongside a series of eight (or sometimes ten) know-
ledges. From the north Indian tradition, and especially the writ-
ings of Vasubandhu and Asanga, the Mahayana traditions of China
and Tibet inherit a system of five paths (marga) and four ‘stages
of penetrative insight’ (nirvedha-bhagiya) which comes to be set
alongside a system of ten ‘levels’ (bhiimi) of the bodhisattva paths
to buddhahood (see Tables 6 and 7).

The scheme of the seven purifications

In the system of seven purifications, the first two (‘purification
of conduct’ and ‘purification of consciousness’) are concerned with

The Buddhist Path 189

good conduct and the practice of calm meditation in the manner
just described. Together these two purifications are seen as the
roots for the five purifications directly concerned with insight.
The first of these is ‘purification of view’, also referred to as
‘the analysis of formations’. At this stage the practitioner is con-
cerned with beginning to break down his sense of a substantial
self. To this end he contemplates any given experience in terms
of the five aggregates, or the six senses and their respective
objects. The purpose here is to impress upon the mind that, when
we look at any particular experience, what we find is not a sub-
stantial person or being but just mind and body in dependence
upon each other. Like two sheaves of grass propped up against
each other, if we remove one the other falls. But in undertaking
this practice we are warned to be careful. Some may be unre-
sponsive to this teaching, but others may go too far and think
that the task is to annihilate themselves.

Having established a sense of experience as subsisting in the
interdependence of mind and body, the practitioner moves on
to the fourth purification, that of ‘crossing over doubt’. The prac-
tice at this stage is referred to as ‘comprehension of conditions’.
In the previous stage the practitioner contemplated the inter-
dependence of mind and body in any given experience; here he
broadens the meditation to take in the past, present, and future.
In other words, the practice moves from the contemplation of
the particular to the general, and one begins to see that what is
in operation is a universal ‘law’—the law of dependent arising;
one begins to see that, just as mind and body are interdependent
now in the present, so they have been in the past and so they
must be in the future. One sees that mind and body, although
existing, have not been created or brought into being out of noth-
ing by some creator God. Thus there is no particular beginning
to their existence and no end. The law of dependent arising alone
is a sufficient explanation of their existence. Direct insight into
this process is presented as deeply affecting the meditator.
His outlook on the world is profoundly changed. His under-
standing of the teaching has ceased to be purely theoretical
and become a matter of direct experience which cannot be
denied. Thus the meditator is said to cross over doubt and

190 The Buddhist Path

thereby complete the fourth purification to become a ‘lesser
attainer of the stream’.

The meditator now moves on to a more committed and
deeper level of insight practice in which he contemplates the world
as made up of various categories and groupings of phenomena
that are all alike impermanent, suffering, and not self. This
results in knowledge based on ‘taking dharmas in groups’; from
this he passes on to ‘the contemplation of rise and fall’. At this
stage he begins to experience directly a world made up not, as
we normally assume, of substantial beings and objects, but of pat-
terns of events rising and falling, coming into existence, and pass-
ing out of existence. A feeling for the meditator’s experience at
this stage is well evoked by the images (drawn from the earlier
texts) that Buddhaghosa gives in this connection: the world is no
longer experienced as consisting of things that are lasting and
solid but rather as something that vanishes almost as soon as it
appears—like dew drops at sunrise, like a bubble on water, like
a line drawn on water, like a mustard-seed placed on the point
of an awl, like a flash of lightning; things in themselves lack sub-
stance and always elude one’s grasp—like a mirage, a conjuring
trick, a dream, the circle formed by a whirling firebrand, a fairy
city, foam, or the trunk of a banana tree.*

This experience is profoundly peaceful and with it the mind
begins to settle into a state of peace close to jhadna. Drawing
on an earlier list, Buddhaghosa describes the mind at this time
as characterized by ten qualities: illumination, knowledge, joy,
tranquillity, happiness, commitment, resolve, alertness, equan-
imity, and, significantly, attachment. Because of the presence of
the last these ten qualities are collectively referred to as ‘the ten
defilements of insight’. What is being said here is that the mind
being so deeply affected by its experience grasps at it and takes
it for the experience of awakening itself. In other words, the prac-
titioner mistakenly concludes that he has reached the end of the
path. The texts warn that the meditator may live for many years
convinced that he or she has attained arhatship. Only when some
experience—like the arising of strong anger or fear—dissuades
him or her from this view does the meditator complete the fifth

The Buddhist Path I9I

purification of ‘knowing and seeing what is the path and not
the path’; the meditator then passes to the sixth purification of
‘knowing and seeing the way’.

So the meditator returns to the practice of the contemplation
of the rise and fall of dharmas, which had been disabled by the
ten defilements of insight. Now, like the lion, king of beasts, who
finds delight, not when put in a golden cage, but only in the three-
thousand-league expanse of the Himalayas, the meditator sees
delight not in the pleasant rebirths of the sense, form, or form-
less realms, but only in his three contemplations of impermanence,
suffering, and no self.*” In addition to the knowledge (1) of see-
ing the rise and fall (of dharmas), the sixth purification is said to
embrace seven other knowledges, making eight in all: the know-
ledge (2) of contemplating breaking up (of dharmas), (3) of the
presence of danger, (4) of contemplating distress, (5) of con-
templating disenchantment, (6) of the desire for release, (7) of
contemplating with discernment, (8) of equanimity with regard
to formations. This sequence of knowledges may be illustrated
by the story of a man who set out to catch a fish:

Taking his fishing net, he sank it into the water. When he put his hand
into the mouth of the net and seized hold of a snake by the neck, he
thought he had caught a fish and was delighted. Thinking that he had
caught a big fish, he lifted it out to take a look but when he saw the three
markings and realised it was a snake he became frightened. Seeing that
he was in danger, he felt distaste for what he had grasped and wished
to be released. Devising a way of getting free, he unwrapped [the coils]
from his arm, beginning with the tip of the tail, and then, raising his arm
and swinging the snake round his head two or three times in order to
weaken it, he flung it away thinking, ‘Be gone damn snake!’ Then with-
out delay he climbed up the bank of the pool and stood there looking
back at the way he had come thinking, ‘Goodness! I have escaped from
the mouth of a huge snake!’**

A person’s initial satisfaction with his sense of his own individu-
ality is likened to the man’s initial delight at grasping a snake. A
meditator’s seeing the three marks of impermanence, suffering,
and no self through (1) seeing the rise and fall and (2) the break-
ing up of phenomena is like the man’s seeing the three markings

192 The Buddhist Path

on the snake. Just as the man became frightened, so the medit-
ator (3) knows the presence of danger; just as he knew fear, so
the meditator (4) contemplates his distress; just as he felt dis-
taste for what he had grasped, so the meditator (5) contemplates
disenchantment; just as he desired to be free of the snake, so too
the meditator (6) desires release; and just as he devised a means
of letting go, so the meditator (7) discerns all dharmas to be imper-
manent, suffering, and no self such that they cannot appear to
him again as lasting, pleasant, beautiful, and self. So with the eighth
knowledge, all formations are seen as empty (sufifia).

The eight knowledges culminate at a point where the mind is
once more settled and at peace. One should not be misled by the
rather elaborate and complex descriptions that are given of what
happens next. In part they seem intended to present the profound
and subtle nature of an experience which happens very rapidly.
With the mind having reached a point of balance, it settles in
transcendent jhana and in a moment it directly sees and under-
stands suffering, its arising, its cessation, and the way leading to
its cessation; it directly sees and experiences nirvana. Accord-
ing to the Theravadin sources this understanding quite literally
occurs in one moment: the conditioned world that is samsara
(suffering and its cause) and nirvana and the transcendent path
(cessation and the path leading to cessation) are finally fully
known in a single flash of transcendent insight and peace. This
is the culmination of previous practice and this moment is itself
termed ‘path’ (magga); in this moment all the conditions that con-
tributed to the development of the path are at once fulfilled.
Frequently these conditions are listed as thirty-seven in all: four
establishings of mindfulness, four right endeavours, four bases
of success in concentration, five spiritual faculties, five spiritual
powers, seven ‘limbs’ of awakening, and the eightfold path itself.
The ‘path’ moment is understood as being immediately followed
by a transcendent jhana of similar qualities, this time termed ‘fruit’
(phala).

The theoretical models of the path allow a number of pos-
sibilities concerning precisely what happens when the mind
settles in transcendent dhyana. In the first place, the mind may

settle at a level of concentration equivalent to any one of the
four dhyanas. When the mind settles in transcendent dhyana,
defilements are not merely temporarily suppressed as in ordinary
dhyana, they are once and for all eradicated. The attainment of
the transcendent path thus changes one into a different person
in the most radical of senses: one ceases to be an ordinary per-
son (prthagjana/puthujjana) and becomes one of the nobles (drya/
ariya), that is one of those who has directly seen the four truths.

From an early period the texts seem.to have envisaged that
the attaining of the transcendent path may not necessarily erad-
icate all defilements immediately. Basically there are four possib-
ilities, depending on which defilements are actually eradicated.
The possibilities are usually set out with reference to the list
of ten bonds or fetters (samyojana) which bind one to rebirth

194 The Buddhist Path

(see above, pp. 72-3). By the abandoning of the first three fet-
ters one becomes a ‘stream-attainer’ (srotapanna/sotapanna),
that is, one whose final awakening is assured within a maximum
of seven rebirths. By the abandoning of the first three and the
permanent weakening of the next two one becomes a ‘once-
returner’ (sakrdagamin/sakadagamin), that is, one whose final
awakening is assured and who will be reborn as a human being
no more than once. By the complete abandoning of the five lower
fetters one becomes a ‘non-returner’ (andgamin), that is, one who
at death will not be reborn as a human being but in one of five
‘Pure Abodes’ (realms corresponding to the fourth dhyana) where
he will gain final awakening. By the complete abandoning of all
ten fetters one becomes an arhat, never to be subject to rebirth
again. The attainment of any of these four successive paths of
stream-attainment, once-return, non-return, and arhatship con-
stitutes the seventh purification of ‘knowledge and seeing’.

What precisely governs which of these four states is attained
is not clear in the earliest texts. Two basic possibilities seem to
be envisaged: either (1) that, at the first arising of the transcend-
ent path, depending on individual circumstances, one may attain
any one of the four states immediately; or (2) that one must attain
each state successively, either in one life or over a series of lives.
The interpretation of the later tradition is also not entirely clear.
Buddhaghosa seems closer to the latter understanding, although
one may attain each state in such rapid succession that one in
effect goes straight from being an ordinary being to being an
arhat. As we shall presently see, Vasubandhu seems closer to the
former.

The scheme of the five paths

The classical north Indian manuals of Vasubandhu and Asanga
map out the path according to a system of five paths: the path of
equipment (sambhdara-marga), the path of application (prayoga-
marga), the path of seeing (darsana-marga), the path of develop-
ment (bhavand-marga), and the path of completion (nistha-marga)
or of the adept (asaiksa-marga).® The path of equipment covers

The Buddhist Path 195

the general basis of the spiritual life in the form of faith, gen-
erosity, good conduct, and the preliminary development of calm
and insight. The path of application consists of the further
development of calm and particularly insight. The path of see-
ing involves a direct seeing of the four truths in the manner of
the seventh purification of Buddhaghosa’s scheme. The path of
development is twofold: either ordinary (/aukika) or transcend-
ent (lokottara). The ordinary path of development consists in
mastery of calm, the attainment of the dhyanas and formless
attainments. The transcendent path of development consists in
the final eradication of attachment to these meditative attainments
and the realms of the cosmos that correspond to them. The
ordinary path of development may thus precede or succeed the
paths of application and seeing: in the case of a practitioner who
develops the dhydnas before turning to insight it precedes, and
in the case of one who develops them after stream-attainment
(accomplished by the path of seeing) it succeeds. The path of
completion is equivalent to the final attainment of arhatship. As
we shall see in Chapter 9, in the Mahayana this scheme of five
paths becomes the basis for the ten stages of the bodhisattva path
(see Table 7).

In his AbhidharmakoSa, Vasubandhu describes the immediate
preparation for the path of application in terms of the practice
of calm meditation based either on meditation on the different
types of ‘ugliness’ or on mindfulness of breathing. The practi-
tioner develops one of these until he or she attains concentra-
tion (samadhi); Vasubandhu does not specify of what degree but
no doubt access or dhydna is intended. The meditator then turns
the mind towards insight by means of the practice of the four
‘establishings of mindfulness’ (smrtyupasthana/satipatthana). This
is an extremely old and important set of meditations based on
different contemplations: of the body, of feeling, of the mind, and
fourthly of physical and mental processes (dharma).”

Essentially what is assumed by the practice of the four ‘estab-
lishings of mindfulness’ is that one attains a certain degree of
mental clarity and calm and then turns one’s attention first of all
to watching various kinds of physical phenomena and activities,

then to watching feeling as pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral, then
to watching one’s general mental state; and finally, at the fourth
stage, to integrating the previous three stages so that finally one
watches the totality of physical and mental processes. This final
stage is equivalent to watching the five aggregates: the world is
seen as consisting simply in the interplay of five groups of phys-
ical and mental events.

Vasubandhu presents this set of contemplations as involving
a gradual movement from the gross to the subtle. His presenta-
tion corresponds closely to Buddhaghosa’s presentation of the
insight practice involved at the stage of the ‘purification of view’.
As the meditator contemplates the world of dharmas his mind
eventually settles in a state of concentration which involves
an initial direct seeing of the four truths. This attainment is
described as the ‘heat’ or ‘glow’ (usmagata) of wisdom and it marks
the first stage of the path of application. The attainment of ‘the

The Buddhist Path 197

glow’ is the first of four ‘stages of penetrating insight’ (nirvedha-
bhagiya); the subsequent three stages are known as summit
(mirdhan), acceptance (ksanti), and the highest ordinary state
(laukikagra-dharma).

The first three of the four stages of penetrating insight are
each divided into three stages of weak, medium, and strong,
making ten stages of penetrative insight in all. These stages rep-
resent successive attainments of states of concentration through
the practice of the fourth manifestation of mindfulness in which
the meditator’s direct understanding of the four truths in all
their aspects is gradually deepened. The culmination of this
process is a single moment of insight—the highest ‘ordinary’
state. This is immediately followed by a direct vision of the four
truths in sixteen aspects—‘the path of seeing’. In contrast to the
Theravadins, the Sarvastivadins suggest that it takes sixteen
‘thought’ moments to see the truths. This appears to be a the-
oretically constructed notion, in part connected with the idea that,
since one can only know one thing at a time, one could not directly
know samsara and nirvana (suffering and its cessation, the con-
ditioned and the unconditioned) in a single moment of thought.
Interestingly the Theravadins suggest one can. But the length of
a moment of thought is understood as so short that even for the
Sarvastivadins the path of seeing is still understood as in effect
instantaneous. Strictly the path of seeing endures for only fifteen
moments, and is once more understood as the fulfilment of all
the thirty-seven conditions contributing to awakening; the six-
teenth moment is taken as belonging to the transcendent path
of development and constitutes the attainment of the transcend-
ent ‘fruit’.

What happens in the attainment of the transcendent path and
fruit is said to depend on one’s previous practice. The meditator
who has previously mastered the attainment of the dhydnas (by
the ordinary path of development) and thereby already estab-
lished a certain ability to let go of craving as far as the world of
the five senses is concerned will, in the path of seeing, once and
for all abandon that craving and become either a once-returner
or a never-returner. The meditator who has not previously

198 The Buddhist Path

mastered the dhyanas eradicates by the path of seeing the grosser
defilements associated with craving for the world of the five
senses and thereby becomes a stream-attainer. By the successive
attainment of the various dhydnas and abandoning of subtler
and subtler kinds of attachment by means of the ordinary and
transcendent paths of development, the meditator subsequently
becomes a once-returner and non-returner. Finally by means of
the path of ‘completion’ or the ‘adept’ and the attainment of the
diamond-like concentration, he or she eradicates all defilements
and becomes an arhat.

All these lists of stages can seem to the modern mind like schol-
astic excess. But what they seem intended to indicate is the grad-
ual and cumulative process of the spiritual path which is kept
going by the meditator’s repeated and persistent practice of
essentially the same exercise: contemplating the world in terms
of dharmas or watching the rise and fall, the coming and going
of phenomena in dependence upon each other. Gradual though
the process is, it is distinguished by various landmarks which the
lists of stages are intended to indicate; what is more it culminates
in a more or less sudden and immediate understanding of the
world which has the effect of changing one for good. Some of
the ancient similes for the progress of meditation practice evoke
the experience of this rather more vividly than all our lists of stages.

As a mason or a mason’s apprentice, when inspecting the handle of his
chisel, sees the impressions of his fingers and thumb and yet has no know-
ledge that so much of the handle has been worn away on that day, so
much the day before, so much previously, but when the last bit has been
worn away then he has knowledge—just so the monk who lives engaged
in the practice of meditation has no knowledge that so much of the
defilements has been worn away that day, so much the day before, so
much previously, but when the last bit has been worn away then he has
knowledge."

The relationship of calm and insight

We have seen how developed Buddhist theory envisages two basic
possibilities as far as meditation is concerned. In the first place,

The Buddhist Path 199

by the practice of calm meditation one abandons the gross for
the sake of the subtle. That is, by seeing certain experiences -
as disturbing, the mind seeks peace in the subtler and subtler
experiences of the dhydnas. This has the effect of weakening
attachment to experiences tied up with the world of the five senses,
but in subtler experiences there lurk subtler attachments which
may not be recognized for what they are. So although defilements
are controlled they are not rooted out. In the second place, by
the practice of insight meditation one sees experiences as inher-
ently flawed because of the characteristics of impermanence,
suffering, and no self, and thus, instead of letting go of the gross
merely to grasp at the subtle, one lets go of them completely.
In this unqualified letting go of the conditioned one experiences
the unconditioned, nirvana. Yet in practice in order to see things
as inherently characterized by impermanence, suffering, and no
self one’s mind must be clear and undisturbed; more significantly
in order to relinquish the subtlest forms of attachment one must
see the subtle experiences of the dhydnas as impermanent, suf-
fering, and not self; and to achieve this one must generally first
of all actually experience them. In this way the practice of calm
and insight meditation are bound up together.

Although the theoretical position of the classical meditation
manuals seems basically clear, the precise relationship of calm
meditation and insight meditation is a live issue for both con-
temporary historical scholarship and contemporary Theravada
practice. Let me begin with the latter issue. Within contempor-
ary Theravada practice there is a broad movement of insight
meditation that has had considerable influence in the West. The
tendency of this movement is to take the view that since the
dhyanas are only impermanent, relatively pleasant states, the med-
itator should not strive to attain dhyana but aim at developing
insight from the outset. Moreover, there is a Buddhist tradition
of seeing the highest understanding of other religions as based
on misinterpreted dhyana experiences. From this perspective, the
dhyanas can thus even be seen as in a sense not characteristic-
ally ‘Buddhist’, since they can be attained in the absence of the
liberating insight which brings direct knowledge of nirvana. At

200 The Buddhist Path

the academic level this kind of thinking is reflected in an author-
itative modern scholarly treatment of Theravada meditation by
Winston King that presents the dhydnas as taken over by the
Buddhist tradition from pre-existing Indian brahmanical yogic
practices.” What Buddhism added was the practice of insight
meditation.

In a controversial but at least in part convincing study,
Johannes Bronkhorst has argued precisely the opposite: what is
innovative and distinctive about early Buddhist meditation is the
attainment of peaceful and pleasant states through the practice
of the dhydanas.* There is no evidence that this kind of medita-
tion existed in India prior to the appearance of Buddhism, and
non-Buddhist Indian writings conceive of meditation or yoga
not as something peaceful and pleasant, but rather as a painful
austerity which burns off accumulated karma and thereby even-
tually removes the cause of further rebirths and thus brings lib-
eration from samsara.

Bronkhorst, like a number of scholars such as La Vallée Poussin,
Frauwallner, Schmithausen, Vetter, Griffiths, and Gombrich, goes
on to see certain inconsistencies in the early texts’ presentation
of, on the one hand, the dhydnas as the path of meditation lead-
ing to arhatship and, on the other hand, discriminating insight
into the four truths, dependent arising and the three marks as
the way to arhatship.* For such scholars what underlies the early
texts is a certain tension between the advocates of the practice
of meditation in the form of the dhyanas and the advocates of
a more intellectual and rational approach. The later systematic
accounts of the path would thus represent a compromise which
tries to reconcile what were in origin quite different conceptions
of the nature of the Buddhist path.

The arguments and textual analyses of these scholars are com-
plex and often extremely philologically sophisticated and I can-
not begin to review them here; a general comment will have to
suffice. That some tension between rival approaches underlies
the texts may be so. Yet, as Lance Cousins has indicated, from
the point of view of the later manuals it is a mistake to see the
tension in terms of either the practice of calm or the practice of

The Buddhist Path 201

insight: the question for them is rather how much calm and
how much insight are required at the various stages of the path.
Even if there is an increased willingness to countenance the pos-
sibility of complete awakening without the the prior basis of the
dhyanas, the later manuals are all agreed that the meditator needs
both, and that the culmination of the path consists in a medi-
tation attainment that consists in the coming together of calm
and insight. To see a certain tension in early Buddhism between
those who emphasize the importance of the dhydnas and those
who advocate the development of insight without the prior basis
of dhyana is not unreasonable. Such a tension does seem to under-
lie the later systematic accounts and is also apparent among
contemporary practitioners. We also perhaps see such a tension
reflected elsewhere, in the history of Mahayana Buddhism: the
Madhyamika approach to ‘emptiness’ appears more orientated
to insight in comparison to the Yogacarin focus on the stages
of calm and the deep, hidden levels of the mind; similarly, in
Tibetan Buddhism, the dGelugs emphasis on analytic meditation
on emptiness contrasts with the rNying ma practice of rdzogs chen
(see Chapters 9 and Io). Yet it is not necessary to see such ten-
sions as originating in fundamentally opposed conceptions of the
nature of the Buddhist path. Such a view assumes, in part at least,
a rather intellectual and rational conception of the nature of insight
meditation. It is also perhaps to confuse the issue with another
tension in the history of the practice of Buddhist monasticism:
the tension between the life of the monk as a forest-dwelling med-
itator and a town-dwelling scholar (see above pp. 95-100).

The systematic and theoretical accounts of the path that I have
focused on in this chapter may not always represent the final word
on meditation practice for practitioners today. Some schools of
China and Tibet have adapted them to bring them in line with
certain principles of Mahayana Buddhism; others such as the Ch’an
and Zen schools on the surface apparently ignore such elaborate
theoretical accounts. But in one way or another these systematic
accounts and the ways of thinking that underlie them have influ-
enced the forms of Buddhist meditation practice of whatever
school.

The Abhidharma
The Higher Teaching

Stories, legends, texts, and authors

It is told by some that after the Buddha gained awakening he
sat beneath the tree of awakening for seven days contemplating
the Dharma which he had penetrated. Then he got up from his
seat and for seven days he stood gazing with unblinking eyes at
the seat thinking, ‘On this seat I gained knowledge.’ At that time
the gods thought that perhaps the Buddha still had something to
accomplish as it appeared he had not abandoned attachment to
the seat of awakening. So the Buddha performed the miracle of
the pairs, emitting streams of fire and water from every pore of
his body. Then for seven days he walked up and down between
the seat of awakening and where he had been standing. Now,
twenty-one days after he had gained awakening, he sat in the
House of Jewels, so called because here, over seven days, he
conceived the seven books of the Abhidharma—the jewels of the
Dharma. On the seventh day, when he began to contemplate
the contents of the seventh book, the Great Book, his body be-
gan to emit rays of six colours: blue, yellow, red, white, maroon,
clear. And as he contemplated this infinite and immeasurable
Dharma, the rays emitted from his body lit up the earth, the waters,
and the skies. They lit up the realms of the gods and flooded beyond
throughout billions of world systems.

The Buddha did not, it seems, immediately teach the Dharma
in this full form in which he had conceived it while seated in the
House of Jewels. Many years later in response to a challenge from
teachers of other schools the Buddha once again performed the
miracle of the pairs, emitting streams of fire and water from every
pore of his body. Having performed this miracle he considered

The Abhidharma 203

what previous buddhas had done after performing this miracle.
It came to his mind that they had ascended to the heaven of the
Thirty-Three gods to teach the Dharma to their mothers. And so,
in keeping with this tradition, the Buddha ascended to the heaven
of the Thirty-Three gods and there, seated beneath the Coral Tree
on the rock called Pandukambala, the throne of the great god
Sakka, for the three months of the rains he taught his mother
and the assembled gods the seven books of the Abhidharma.

At that time the Buddha would create a mind-made Buddha
to carry on teaching while he went to gather alms food in the dis-
tant land of Uttarakuru. Then he would sit down on the shores
of Lake Anotatta, eat his meal, and retire to sit in meditation
in a forest of sandal trees. And Sariputta, the disciple chief in wis-
dom, would come and the Buddha would teach him the method
of Abhidharma. Sariputta in turn taught it to five hundred of
his own pupils. They say that many aeons ago in the time of the
Buddha Kassapa they had been born as bats and, hanging in a
cave, they had one day heard the sound of two monks reciting
the Abhidharma. Of course, as bats they were unable to under-
stand the meaning of what they heard, yet even so it seems that
the very sound of the Abhidharma left an impression. So they
were reborn in the world of the gods, where they remained for
the vast interval of time between one Buddha and the next. Fin-
ally they were born as men and became monks and the pupils
of Sariputta, who, teaching them the seven books, made them
masters of Abhidharma.'

The term abhidharma (Pali abhidhamma) means approximately
‘higher’ or ‘further’ Dharma. For Buddhist tradition it refers to
two things: first, a set of books regarded by most ancient schools
as ‘the word of the Buddha’ and as such forming the contents of
the third basket of scriptures, the Abhidharma Pitaka; secondly,
the particular system of thought and method of exposition set
out in those books and their commentaries. The above legend
of the genesis of the Abhidharma is drawn from Theravadin
sources, but the sentiment is indicative of a more general tradi-
tional attitude to the Abhidharma.’ The Abhidharma is thought

204 The Abhidharma

out and taught only by a buddha. Hearing it being recited—even
without understanding it—can have a far-reaching effect. The
Abhidharma catches the very essence of the Dharma, which means
that its sound can operate almost as a charm or spell.

The suggestion in the legend that the form in which the
Abhidharma has come down to us has been mediated through
the person of Sariputra perhaps reflects the historical reality that
the canonical Abhidharma works must be regarded as somewhat
later than the siitra material of the Nikayas/Agamas, and in part
explains why some schools of thought, such as the Sautrantikas
(‘those who follow the teaching of the siitras’), later declined to
give the Abhidharma works the status of ‘the word of the Buddha’
(see Chapter 2). The two canonical Abhidharma collections that
survive are those of the Theravadins and the Sarvastivadins, the
latter only in Chinese translation. All the books of the Theravadin
Abhidharma, with the exception of the Yamaka, have been
translated into English; the Sarvastivadin canonical Abhidharma
works remain untranslated into a modern European language.

Both these collections consist of seven books but their titles
and contents vary considerably. None the less they share two tasks
in common. In the first place they attempt to give a systematic
and exhaustive account of the world by breaking it down into its
constituent physical and mental events (dharma/dhamma). Sec-
ondly, they both contain works which address various points of
dispute that arise out of the preceding exercise. Although the
status of the Abhidharma as word of the Buddha may have been
challenged, the stamp that the Abhidharma systems, methods,
and debates have left on subsequent Buddhist thought is indis-
putable. They provide the terms of reference and determine the
agenda which result in the Mahayana schools of Madhyamaka
and Yogacara.

Apart from the canonical Abhidharma, a great variety of
Abhidharma manuals exist. These manuals aim at introducing the
essentials of the complicated canonical systems. For the Theravadins,
Buddhaghosa’s comprehensive Visuddhimagga contains much of
their Abhidharma system; chapters 14 to 17 form a self-contained

section entitled ‘the ground of understanding’ (panna-bhimi) which
is essentially an introduction to the Theravadin Abhidharma. A
more direct introduction to the canonical Theravadin Abhidharma
is the Abhidhammavatara (‘Introduction to Abhidharma’) writ-
ten in the fifth century by Buddhadatta, a contemporary of Bud-
dhaghosa. But the most commonly used introductory manual in
the countries of Theravada Buddhism today is a twelfth-century
work of Anuruddha, the Abhidhammattha-sangaha (‘Compendium
of the Topics of Abhidharma’).

In the second or third century cE, Sarvastivadin Abhidharmikas
(‘exponents of Abhidharma’) in north-west India began compil-
ing an authoritative Abhidharma commentary or vibhdsa. This
survives in Chinese translation in three different recensions. Of
particular influence were the views of the Kasmira Sarvastivadins,

206 The Abhidharma

who are often simply referred to as the Vaibhasikas (exponents
of the Vibhasa). In the early centuries of the Christian era the
Sarvastivadins also produced a number of summary Abhidharma
manuals such as the *Abhidharma-hrdaya (‘The Heart of Abhid-
harma’) of Dharmasri and the *Abhidharmamrtarasa (‘The Taste
of the Deathless’) of Ghosaka.? But by far the most influential
manual for later Chinese and Tibetan Buddhism is Vasubandhu’s
AbhidharmakoSa (‘Treasury of Abhidharma’). The influence of
this work is to be explained in part by the fact that for the
Chinese and Tibetans its author is none other than Vasubandhu,
brother of Asanga and author of some of the seminal treatises
of the Yogacara, one of the principal schools of Mahayana
Buddhist thought. This traditional view has been disputed by mod-
ern scholarship, notably by Frauwallner, who has argued that the
Mahayanist Vasubandhu, author of Yogacarin treatises, lived in
the fourth century ce and must be distinguished from the
Vasubandhu who is author of the AbhidharmakoSa and lived in
the early part of the fifth century. The question is unresolved.*
Whoever he was, Vasubandhu’s KoSa gives a masterly survey of
Sarvastivada-Vaibhasika Abhidharma supplemented by his own
critique of certain positions, which often betrays a Sautrantika
sympathy. Such was the authority of the Abhidharmakosa that
Paramartha’s and Hsiian-tsang’s Chinese translations (in the
sixth and seventh centuries respectively) led to the formation of
a significant, if relatively short-lived, school of Sino-Japanese
Buddhism named, after the text, the Koga or, in Chinese and
Japanese, the Chii-shé/Kusha school. Vasubandhu’s criticism
of certain Vaibhasika positions prompted further works that
attempted to address his points of criticism, such as Sanghabhadra’s
* A bhidharma-samaya-pradipika (‘Ilumination of Abhidharma’)
and *Nydyanusara (‘In Accordance with Method’), and the an-
onymous Abhidharma-dipa (‘The Lamp of Abhidharma’).

A number of Indian Abhidharma texts that belong neither to the
Theravadin nor to the Sarvastivadin Abhidharma also survive in
Chinese translation, principally the Sariputrabhidharma-sastra
(‘Treatise on the Abhidharma of Sariputra’) and Harivarman’s
*Satya-siddhi-sastra (‘Treatise on the Demonstration of Truth’),

The Abhidharma 207

but in such texts we do not have a full system in the manner of
the Theravadin or Sarvastivadin Abhidharma. A third complete
system of Abhidharma is, however, elaborated in certain of
the works of the Mahayana Yogacara tradition, principally in
Asanga’s Abhidharma-samuccaya (‘Compendium of Abhidharma’)
and in Hsiian-tsang’s commentary on Vasubandhu’s Trimsika
(‘Thirty Verses’), the Ch’eng-wei-shih lun or Vijfapti-matrata-
siddhi (‘Demonstration of the Theory of Mind Only’). While this
Yogacarin Abhidharma owes much to the Sarvastivadin system, it
also incorporates and adapts certain aspects of other Abhidharma
systems in order to present a complete Abhidharma in accord-
ance with a Mahayanist outlook and the view that mind (vijfapti)
alone is ultimately ‘real’.

The Abhidharma as a system of Buddhist thought

As a system of thought Abhidharma is to be contrasted with
Siitranta (Pali suttanta), the system of the siitras or discourses
of the Buddha. Siitranta is regarded as the application of the
principles of the Buddha’s teaching to a particular situation: each
siitra preserved in the Nikaya/Agama collections is a discourse
delivered by the Buddha, or one of his disciples, at a particular
time, in a particular place, and to a particular person or group.
Siitranta teachings are embellished with poetic language, with
similes and metaphors that inspire the listener. The Abhidharma
method, in contrast, presents the Buddha’s teachings without mak-
ing concessions to time or place or audience, and in technical
terms that are precisely defined to ensure analytical exactitude.
The contrast between the methods of Sitranta and Abhidharma
coincides in part with other distinctions sometimes made in
the texts between types of teachings. Some teachings are said
to be expressed in terms whose meaning must be determined
(neyartha/neyyattha), while others are expressed in terms whose
meaning is already determined (nitartha/nitattha). Some teachings
are expressed in conventional terms (samvrti/sammuti), others
are expressed in ultimate terms (paramartha/paramattha). The

208 The Abhidharma

point of these distinctions is to draw attention to the fact that,
as we have seen in Chapter 6, if we come across a Buddhist text
that talks in terms of persons and selves, we should not imme-
diately assume that the teaching of no self is being undermined;
it is rather that that particular text is talking in conventional terms
whose ultimate meaning needs drawing out. The later tradition
would regard the Nikaya/Agama collections of sitras as in fact
containing teachings of both kinds.

What is distinctive about the Abhidharma is that it is an at-
tempt to give a comprehensive statement of the Buddha’s teach-
ings exclusively in ultimate terms. A useful analogy, I think, for
the relationship between the Abhidharma and the Sitranta is that
of the relationship between a grammar book of a language and
the language as spoken and used. In the same way as a grammar
book aims at giving a bare account of how a particular language
works, its structure and forms of expression, based on observa-
tion of the actual use of that language, so the Abhidharma is an
attempt to lay bare and describe accurately and precisely, allow-
ing for all circumstances and eventualities, the underlying struc-
ture of the Dharma as found in the discourses of the Buddha.
Indeed, the pages of certain Abhidharma texts, with their lists
of terms and definitions, might be mistaken for the pages of a
grammar book, and in the same way that reading a grammar book
may not seem the most inspiring of pastimes, so too may the study
of Abhidharma. Yet a good grammar book may impress one with
its clear and intelligent account of a language; it may bring one
to a better understanding of that language and equip one to
recognize unexpected forms of words and modes of expression.
In a similar way the sheer cleverness and intricacy of aspects
of the Abhidharma is impressive in itself. Indeed, one scholar
has described the seventh book of the Theravadin Abhidharma,
the Patthana (‘Causal Relations’), as ‘one of the most amazing
productions of the human mind’.* Moreover it is the study of
Abhidharma that allows the practitioner to extrapolate from the
peculiarities of his own experience to the peculiarities of another’s.
These days the study of grammar may not be very fashionable
and some may point out that grammarians and lexicographers

The Abhidharma 209

do not always make the best poets, writers, or orators. But just
as the theoretical understanding of language cannot be achieved
without the study of grammar, so the theoretical understand-
ing of Buddhism must be based in the study of some form of
Abhidharma.

Abhidharma represents the theoretical counterpart to what the
meditator actually experiences in meditation. It can be summed
up as the attempt to give a systematic and exhaustive account of
the world in terms of its constituent physical and mental events.
This enterprise has two aspects: first, to categorize all possible
types of event; secondly, to consider all possible ways in which
those mental events can interact and so categorize the various
kinds of causal relationships.

Physical and mental events are known as dharmas (Pali
dhamma). The relationship between Dharma and dharmas might
be stated as follows. Dharma is the way things ultimately are;
it is also the Buddha’s teaching since this is in accordance with
the way things ultimately are. Physical and mental events are the
ultimate building blocks of the way things ultimately are; thus to
understand the Buddha’s teaching and see Dharma is to see things
in terms of dharmas.

Ultimately dharmas are all that there is. In this respect dharmas
are very like atoms (when atoms were regarded as the ulti-
mate ‘bits’ of matter). Thus just as a table might be analysed by
a chemist as consisting of innumerable atoms, so a person is ana-
lysed by Abhidharma as consisting of innumerable dharmas.
While the analogy of atoms is a useful one, we must always bear
in mind that dharmas embrace both physical and mental things,
not just physical ones. These mental and physical events that are
dharmas fall into various classes. Again this is analogous to the
way atoms are of different types: there are hydrogen atoms, oxy-
gen atoms, lead atoms, gold atoms, and so on. In fact chemistry
tells us that the physical world is constructed out of one hundred
or so basic types of atom. So, just as the wood that makes up a
table can be analysed into atoms of various elements, a person’s
mind and body can be analysed into dharmas of various classes.
Again we should be careful in using this analogy. In so far as

210 The Abhidharma

we think of atoms as bits of matter there is a tendency for the
layman to conceive of them as inert enduring things, despite what
modern nuclear physics tells us to the contrary. Similarly, as we
saw in the context of insight meditation, dharmas are not endur-
ing substances, they are evanescent events, here one moment and
gone the next—like dewdrops at sunrise or a bubble on water,
like a mirage or a conjuring trick.

Just as there is a more or less finite number of elements, so
there is a more or less finite number of classes of dharmas.
But we should also note that the term dharma is used both of a
particular instance of a class of dharma and of the whole class.
Thus according to the Sarvastivadins the number of dharmas is
seventy-five, meaning not that there are only seventy-five events
in the world—given the duration of a dharma the world would
be over in a very short time—but that there are only seventy-
five possible types of event. The Yogacarins count some one
hundred classes, while later Theravadin sources give eighty-two
classes of dharma.° Let us take a closer look at the Theravadin
analysis, the basic principles of which are shared with the other
Abhidharma systems.

Eighty-one types of dharma are ‘conditioned’ (samkhata). That
is to say, the conditioned world of samsara from the lowest hell
realms to the highest heavens of the Brahma world is con-
structed from the combination of these dharmas. The eighty-
second dharma is the unconditioned (asamkhata), namely nirvana.
Conditioned dharmas fall into three main groups: consciousness
(citta), associated mentality (cetasika), and physical phenomena
(ripa). The first, consciousness, constitutes a single class of
dharma; the second, associated mentality, comprises fifty-two
classes of dharma; the third, physical phenomena, comprises
twenty-eight classes of dharma. Each of these eighty-one classes
of dharma is precisely defined by, among other things, a distinc-
tive characteristic (lakkhana). For example, greed (Jobha) is one
particular class of dharma. The nature of greed may vary from
a mild wanting as one gazes through a shop window to an un-
stoppable craving. Yet all dharmas that are instances of ‘greed’
share the distinctive characteristic of ‘grasping at some object’;

The Abhidharma 211

this is what defines them as greed as opposed to some other
dharma.

In this technical sense of a dharma the characteristic of ‘con-
sciousness’ is the bare sense of being aware of some object: it is
the phenomenon of being conscious of something. We can never
actually experience just this bare consciousness, for ‘conscious-
ness’ never arises as a single isolated dharma; according to the
Abhidharma, for the mind to be aware of some object it needs
the help of a number of associated mental factors, some of the
fifty-two dharmas of the associated mentality group. The min-
imum number of associated mental factors required is seven. In
other words, to be conscious in fact requires the occurrence of
a minimum of eight dharmas: consciousness, contact, feeling, recog-
nition, volition, one-pointedness, life-faculty, and bringing-to-mind.

I shall pass over the precise technical definitions that the
Abhidharma supplies for each of these dharmas, but the basic
Abhidharma conception of how the mind functions is this: a col-
lection of at least eight dharmas (consciousness and associated
mental factors) arises for a moment and then falls away to be
immediately followed by the next combination of conscious-
ness and associated mental factors. Each combination is con-
scious of just one object. The arising and passing of each moment
of consciousness is understood to occur extremely rapidly—so
rapidly that a countless number passes even in a finger-snap. The
flow of consciousness is thus analogous to the rapid sequence
of the frames of a movie film; consciousness is experienced as
a continuous flow, but is in fact made up of the rapidly occur-
ring sequence of consciousness moments, each with a particular
object. We may think that we are thinking of two or three things
at once, but according to the Abhidharmikas we are just very
rapidly turning from one thing to another and back again. Sim-
ilarly we experience each moment of consciousness as unified,
yet rather like the way in which a colour photograph in a printed
book is seen as an unbroken whole when it is in fact made up
of countless tiny dots of just four colours, so consciousness is
made up of separate dharmas. Thus, to extend the analogy, the
infinite variety and richness of the mind is to be explained by the

212 The Abhidharma

combination of just eighty-one classes of dharma. Indeed, accord-
ing to an old image, the mind is far more complex, subtle, and
varied than any painting.” Moreover the arising of dharmas is
seamless and the difficulty of distinguishing different kinds of
dharma in actual experience is compared to tasting the waters
of the sea and knowing that certain water comes from one river
and certain water from another river.’

The term citta or consciousness is used in two senses: (1) as a
name for one of the eighty-one classes of dharma, namely the
bare phenomenon of consciousness; (2) as a term for a given com-
bination of consciousness and its associated mental factors. Con-
sciousness in this second sense might be compared to a hand:
the hand excluding the fingers is like the bare dharma of con-
sciousness (the first sense), while the fingers are like the various
associated mental factors; a given arising of consciousness is
thus analogous to consciousness experiencing or picking up and
handling a particular object by means of the associated mental
factors. The flow of consciousness involves the mind picking up
and putting down successive objects by means of successive sets
of associated mental factors. In fact an old image from the siitras
compares the mind to a monkey swinging quickly through the
trees in the forest: as soon as it lets go of one branch it grasps
another.’

Although there is a total of fifty-two types of associated
mental factor, only certain combinations of these are possible;
for example it is impossible for the mental factors of greed and
aversion to arise together in the same moment of consciousness
for the simple reason that it is not possible to want something
and not want it in the same moment—this does not, of course,
mean that we cannot want something one moment and not want
it the next. As I have already mentioned, for the Theravadins
the simplest kind of consciousness that can occur involves seven
associated mental factors. More complex consciousnesses involve
up to a maximum of thirty-six types of associated mental factor.
The Theravadin Abhidharma tabulates a system of eighty-nine
basic classes of consciousness based on possible combinations
of consciousness and associated mental factors. Normal human

The Abhidharma 213

consciousness involves forty-five of these classes of conscious-
ness. Of the other forty-four, eighteen concern the mind that has
attained ordinary jhana (either in meditation or as a result of rebirth
in one of the Brahma worlds), eight concern the mind that has
attained transcendent jhdna (at the moment of attaining one
of the paths and fruits of stream-attainment, once-return, non-
return or arhatship), and eighteen are restricted to the con-
sciousness of one who is awakened.

The forty-five classes of normal consciousness fall into four
broad groups: seventeen rootless (ahetuka), twelve unwholesome
(akusala) consciousnesses, eight wholesome (kusala) classes of
consciousness, and eight consciousnesses that are the karmic
results (vipaka) of wholesome consciousness. The seventeen
rootless classes of consciousness are so called because they are
motivated neither by greed, aversion or delusion, nor by non-
attachment, friendliness, or wisdom; they are considered to
operate in a largely mechanical way in the processes of simply
seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, or touching something. Of the
remaining kinds of consciousness, the unwholesome and whole-
some are bound up with the way we react to what we experience
through the senses, while the eight resultants principally oper-
ate as bhavanga, our basic state of mind when no active mental
process is occurring (for example, in deep, dreamless sleep).
Thus if we crave or cling to what we see, hear, smell, taste, or
touch then we experience one of the eight types of conscious-
ness rooted in greed; if we feel annoyed or irritated by it we
experience one of the two types of consciousness rooted in aver-
sion; if we simply feel dull or confused then we experience one
of the two types of consciousness rooted in delusion. On the other
hand, instead of feeling attached, irritated, or dull, we may feel
generous, friendly, and awake.

One aspect of the Buddhist conception of a wholesome or
‘healthy’ mind is made particularly clear in the Abhidharma. That
is that we should not confuse enjoyment with greed or desire.
According to the Buddhist analysis feeling is of five basic types:
painful physical sensation, enjoyable physical sensation, men-
tal pleasure, mental displeasure, and neutral feeling. Painful or

214 The Abhidharma

enjoyable sensations are neither wholesome or unwholesome,
but considered to be the results of previous unwholesome or
wholesome karma respectively. Mental displeasure only occurs
in unwholesome consciousness rooted in aversion. In fact it is
the distinctive characteristic of these types of consciousness.
Thus, if there is mental displeasure, then we know that there is
unwholesome consciousness. Mental pleasure and neutral feel-
ing are more subtle. They can accompany both consciousness
rooted in greed and consciousness rooted in non-attachment,
friendliness, and wisdom. Accordingly mental pleasure may be
a characteristic of both unwholesome and wholesome conscious-
ness. That wholesome consciousness is, on the Buddhist view,
associated with pleasant states of mind is in line with the Bud-
dhist goal of finding a complete cessation of suffering. Thus
Buddhist thought would resist any suggestion that, in teaching
that the world is dukkha or ‘suffering,’ it presents a bleak and
depressing outlook on the world. What Abhidharma analysis
makes clear is that wholesome states of mind—those that con-
duce to relinquishing of attachments, those that possess the seeds
of understanding and wisdom, those that resemble most closely
the states of mind of one who is awakened—are precisely not un-
pleasant states of mind. This is not to say that one who attempts
to put Buddhist teaching into practice immediately leaves behind
all unpleasant and unwholesome states of mind—certainly the
mind may experience much pain and suffering before it finally
relinquishes its attachments. Yet it is not necessarily so.
According to another Abhidharma classification there are
those whose practice is unpleasant and who take a long time
to come to understanding; there are those whose practice is
unpleasant but who come to understanding quickly; on the other
hand there are those whose practice is pleasant who come to under-
standing slowly; and there are those whose practice is pleasant
and who also come to understanding quickly.'° The point I am
making here by way of reference to the Abhidharma is essen-
tially the same point as was made by Bronkhorst on the basis of
historical arguments about the nature of Buddhist meditation which
we met at the end of the last chapter. The Buddhist path aims

The Abhidharma 215

at the cultivation of happy and balanced states of mind as the
basis for the gaining of the understanding that liberates the mind
by rooting out greed, aversion, and delusion.

The consciousness process, karma, and rebirth

For the Theravadin Abhidharma there are two basic modes of
the mind: the mind that is involved in process (vithi-citta) and
the mind that is free of process (vithi-mutta). The mind that is
in process is the mind that is actively perceiving objects and
reacting to those objects; the mind that is free of process is
resting in the inactive mode known as bhavanga. This inactive
mode characteristically occurs in deep, dreamless sleep. How-
ever, according to the theory of consciousness process, the mind
momentarily returns to the inactive mode of bhavanga between
each consciousness process. The mind in this inactive mode of
bhavanga is compared to a spider resting in the middle of its web."
The web extends out in different directions and when one of
the threads of the web is struck by an insect the spider in the
middle stirs, and then runs out along the thread and bites into
the insect to drink its juice. Similarly, when one of the senses is
stimulated, the mind, like the spider, wakes up and adverts to
the ‘door’ of the particular sense in question. Like a spider run-
ning out along the thread, the mind is then said in due order to
perceive the object, receive it, investigate it, and establish its nature.
Finally, again like our spider, the mind enjoys and savours the
object. As I have already indicated, this whole process occurs
extremely rapidly. In fact what one would ordinarily experience
as the simple awareness that one is, say, looking at a beautiful
lotus flower is understood to be constructed from countless sense-
door consciousness processes of the type just described, as well
as mind-door processes internalizing the information received
through the senses.”

In the simple consciousness process the functions of perceiv-
ing, receiving, and investigating an object are said to be performed
by classes of rootless resultant consciousness. That is to say,
the nature of the sense data presented to our minds is regarded

216 The Abhidharma

as determined by our previous actions. Whenever I see, hear,
smell, taste, or touch something that is intrinsically ‘desirable’
(ittha) or pleasing, I experience a result of previous wholesome
consciousness; whenever I see, hear, smell, taste or touch some-
thing that is intrinsically ‘undesirable’ (anittha) or unpleasing
I experience a result of previous unwholesome consciousness.
The basic experiences that I have are thus the result of my pre-
vious karma and beyond my immediate control; they come to
me whether I wish for them or not. But in each consciousness
process the mind has a choice in how it will react to the experi-
enced object. It is only the final stage when the mind has chosen
to enjoy and savour its object in some way that actively unwhole-
some or wholesome consciousness plays its part and sows the seeds
that will bear future results. In this way the Abhidharma in effect
provides an exact small-scale analysis of the process of depend-
ent arising.

The theory of bhavanga consciousness requires some further
comment.'? Bhavanga is the state of mind a being is born with
and it is the state of mind to which a being returns in deep, dream-
less sleep and in between every consciousness process. More
strictly it is the state of mind that arises at the moment of con-
ception in the womb, forming the link (patisandhi) between one
life and the next. The particular characteristics of a bhavanga
consciousness are unique to an individual being; a particular
bhavanga thus reproduces itself and recurs throughout a being’s
life, defining that being as an individual. For human beings the
function of bhavanga is performed by one of eight general classes
of wholesome resultant consciousness. Like the consciousnesses
that perceive, receive, and investigate an object, these kinds of
consciousness are the results of previous karma. But unlike the
former they are not rootless; rather they have the roots of non-
attachment, friendliness, and sometimes also wisdom. They are
therefore much richer and complex kinds of consciousness.

The basis of a rebirth as a human being is then one of these
eight types of consciousness that are the result of previous
wholesome karma. This wholesome karma may have been per-
formed many lifetimes ago; more often it is wholesome karma

The Abhidharma 217

done in the immediately previous life that is significant. What is
said to be crucial in the process of rebirth is one’s state of mind
at the time of death. It is understood that at death significant
acts performed during one’s life tend to present themselves to
one’s mind. Certain kinds of action—for example, certain types
of murder—are regarded as so ‘weighty’ that they cannot but come
to mind at the time of death. In the absence of these what tends
to come to mind are one’s habitual actions or the actions that
one performs close to the actual time of death. The widespread
Buddhist understanding that actions performed at the time of
death can be of crucial significance in determining the nature
of one’s rebirth relates to various customs aimed at turning the
mind of a dying person to some meritorious action that he or she
has performed. Thus flowers, incense, lamps, or chanting may
be offered on the dying person’s behalf. And because the dead
person’s new state may be short-lived or, in the Tibetan view, a
temporary ‘in-between state’, relatives and friends may continue
to perform actions for his or her benefit for some time after death.
The Tibetan belief in the bar-do or ‘in-between state’ (antara-
bhava) is inherited from the Sarvastivadin Abhidharma and is
associated with the elaborate practices of the Bar-do Thos-grol,
the so-called Tibetan Book of the Dead. This notion of the ‘in-
between state’ was a subject of dispute among ancient Indian
schools of Buddhism; the Theravadins denied that it was co-
herent from an Abhidharma perspective, since an in-between
existence must be another kind of existence.’

Essentially Abhidharma is a device for promoting mindfulness
and understanding. The study of Abhidharma encourages the
practitioner to pay attention to the kinds of mental states that
are occurring whatever he or she is doing. It also draws the prac-
titioner’s attention to the way in which the spiritual process is
understood to unfold. To this extent it can be seen as simply
the elaboration of the analysis of the five aggregates and the
twelvefold chain of dependent arising.

One cannot make oneself think nice things or have beauti-
ful wholesome thoughts by simply wishing it. The mind works
according to certain laws and principles that are in significant

218 The Abhidharma

respects beyond our conscious control. That is to say, certain things
happen to us because of previous actions; we react to things in
certain ways because of past tendencies and patterns of thought
which nurture deep-rooted habits. Thus I may decide that
aggressive behaviour is unwholesome and that I will no longer
indulge my temper; yet when provoked, when the conditions arise,
I still find myself unable to control my temper. We react in un-
wholesome and unhealthy ways because greed, hatred, and delu-
sion have not been rooted out. These tendencies lurk in our minds,
and when the appropriate conditions arise they come to the fore.
On the other hand there are also present in the mind the seeds
of wholesome and healthy states of mind. According to the the-
ory of the Buddhist path these must be gradually and patiently
nurtured and cultivated. The process is compared to the way in
which a hen cannot simply hatch her chicks by a mere wish; she
must sit patiently nurturing the eggs until suddenly they finally
hatch.'¢

Some Abhidharma problems

The Abhidharma analysis represents a continuation of two
aspects of Buddhist theory: the breaking down of the individual
into its constituent parts and the analysis of the causal relations
that exist between those parts. As we saw in the account of ‘no
self’ in Chapter 6, the first is characterized by the analysis of
a being into the five skandhas or aggregates of physical and
mental phenomena; the second by the analysis of causality in
terms of the twelve links of dependent arising. The first counters
the ‘eternalist’ tendency of beings to cling to the view that their
existence is substantial and enduring; the second the ‘nihilist’
tendency to see the world and their own existence as chaotic
and meaningless. Again, as we saw in Chapter 6, past and pre-
sent critics of Buddhist theory argue that the breaking up of the
individual into parts cannot account for the experienced facts
of personal continuity and ends in devaluing the moral status
of the individual. Buddhist thought counters that such a criti-
cism does not take proper account of the causal continuity that

The Abhidharma 219

exists between the parts, and that anyway it is true that we must
relinquish attachment to our own individuality in order to act
selflessly.

The rigorous Abhidharma analysis of the mind and body in
terms of linear series of momentary dharmas arising and ceas-
ing in every moment meant that Buddhist thought was required
to give an equally rigorous intellectual account of the processes
that govern psychological and bodily continuity. For example, I
can remember past events, but if the dharmas that constituted
those events no longer exist, what is it that I remember? More
significantly, how can something that no longer exists have
an effect in the present? Buddhist practice is based on the fact
that actions have various kinds of results. Wholesome and un-
wholesome actions lead to pleasant and unpleasant results in
the future—sometimes in far distant future lives. Yet how can
an action performed many lifetimes ago suddenly have an effect
now? Moreover, according to Buddhist thought, actions are habit-
forming, creating tendencies in the mind. Yet if actions begin and
cease in every moment how do these tendencies accumulate, how
do we learn to do things? And how is it that an acquired skill
like swimming or speaking a language can be retained when it
is not used, even for many years? And crucially, where is the poten-
tiality for anger when it is not active? Suppose that I am sitting
peacefully experiencing thoughts of generosity and friendliness
towards the world. At that time, according to Abhidharma, there
is no occurrence of thoughts motivated by greed, aversion, or
delusion, but only of thoughts motivated by non-attachment,
friendliness, and wisdom; therefore my mental state should not
be distinguishable from an arhat’s or even a Buddha’s. Yet if Mara
should send his armies against me or if his daughters should appear
before me, it would probably not be long before a state of fear
or hatred or desire arose in me. So here is the difference: in me
there is a potentiality for greed, hatred, and delusion that is
not found in a Buddha or arhat. But how does the potentiality
for unwholesome thought suddenly emerge from wholesome
thoughts, and how do wholesome dharmas operate as a condi-
tion for unwholesome dharmas?

220 The Abhidharma

One of the most intellectually creative explanations of these
related sets of questions is expounded by the Sarvastivadins. Their
theories are in the first place based on a radical understanding
of the nature of time, the view that all three times—present, past,
and future—exist (sarvasti-vada). According to this view, to say
of dharmas that they are future or past is not to say that they
do not exist; they exist, but they happen to exist in the past or
the future, just as other dharmas happen, for a moment, to exist
in the present. Time is thus conceived as a kind of dimension
through which dharmas travel. Four different ways of under-
standing this are associated with the names of four Sarvastivadin
theorists of the early centuries cE. From the perspective of mod-
ern philosophy Buddhadeva’s suggestion that a dharma can be
said to be ‘present’, relative to simultaneous dharmas, ‘past’ relat-
ive to dharmas that come after and ‘future’ relative to dharmas
that come before—like a woman who is daughter and mother
—is perhaps the most philosophically subtle.'7 Nevertheless it
was the view of Vasumitra that apparently carried the most
authority: a dharma moving through the different times does not
change in essential nature but only in position (avasthda), just as
in decimal counting a ‘one’ signifies ‘one’, ‘ten’ or ‘one hundred’
according to position. .

In connection with their understanding of the existence of
dharmas in the three times, the Sarvastivadins proposed two
dharmas that governed the operation of dharmas. As an ordin-
ary unenlightened person, when one experiences, say, desire, there
is a ‘possession’ (prapti) of present desire; but when it is past,
although there may be no ‘possession’ of present desire, there is
still a ‘possession’ of past desire and also one of its future results;
this ‘possession’ of the future result will continue to reproduce
itself from moment to moment until it matures into a ‘posses-
sion’ of a present result. For an unenlightened person there is
also ‘non-possession’ (aprapti) of certain kinds of wholesome
dharmas associated with the higher stages of meditation and the
Buddhist path; such ‘non-possession’ is not the mere absence
of these wholesome dharmas but a real dharma in itself which
must be destroyed, along with the ‘possessions’ of unwholesome

The Abhidharma 221

dharmas, by the practice of the path. Critics of the Sarvastivadins
objected that if ‘possession’ is a dharma like other dharmas
then it must require ‘possession’ in order to operate: there would
have to be possession of ‘possession’ of ‘possession’ and so on,
ad infinitum. The Sarvastivadins responded with the notion of a
‘secondary possession’ (anuprapti) that both possessed and was
in turn possessed by the primary possession.

For certain Buddhist theorists the intellectual sophistica-
tion, not to say abstraction, of the Sarvastivadin analyses rendered
them problematic. Among the critics of the Sarvastivada a group
styled the Sautrantikas or ‘those who follow the method of the
siitras’ are especially important for the subsequent history of
Buddhist thought. Although the Sautrantikas did not accept
the Abhidharma as the ‘word of the Buddha’, it would be wrong
to think of them as rejecting the Abhidharma method in its
entirety. In fact the basic Abhidharma system is largely assumed
by their criticisms; it is particular doctrines characteristic of the
Vaibhasika-Sarvastivada Abhidharma that they took issue with.
Two theories are especially associated with their name: the the-
ory of the radical momentariness of dharmas and the theory
of seeds.

Rejecting the idea of dharmas existing in the three times of
present, past, and future, Sautrantikas criticized the Sarvastivadin
conception of the duration of a dharma in the present moment.
For the Sarvastivadins dharmas are substantial realities (dravya),
existing in their own right, which for a moment operate in the
present. From this perspective, the present moment although a
very short period of time, is none the less a period of time. There
is no Sarvastivadin consensus on the length of a moment but figures
given in the texts work out at between 0.13 and 13 milliseconds.'®
Yet, object the Sautrantikas, if something endures unchanged
for even a moment, then the fundamental Buddhist principle of
impermanence is compromised. If things are truly impermanent,
then they must be changing continuously and cannot remain
static for any period of time, however short." This kind of think-
ing led to the conception of moments as point instants of time
which, just as geometric points have no extension in space, have

222 The Abhidharma

no duration in time. It is in the light of this that we should under-
stand the Abhidharma account of the twelve links of inter-
dependent arising occurring in a moment: analyse reality down
to the shortest conceivable moment of time and what we still find
is a process rather than inert, or static bits.

Instead of the theory of ‘possession’ the Sautrantikas pro-
posed that the mechanism whereby dharmas produce effects
long after they cease to exist can be understood by reference to
the images of seeds and ‘perfuming’.”” When I perform an action
motivated by greed, it plants a ‘seed’ in the series of dharmas
that is my mind. Such a seed is not a thing in itself—a dharma—
but merely the modification or ‘perfuming’ of the subsequent flow
of dharmas consequent upon the action. In the course of time
this modification matures and issues in a particular result, in the
same way as a seed does not produce its fruit immediately, but
only after the ‘modifications’ of the shoot, stem, leaf, and flower.
The Sautrantikas also suggested that there are two types of
seed. In addition to seeds that are planted by our wholesome and
unwholesome deeds, there are certain seeds that subsist in the
mental continuum of beings from time immemorial; such seeds
constitute an innate potentiality for wholesome behaviour that
can never be destroyed. In the Sautrantika theory of seeds we
have the precursors of two extremely important concepts of later
Mahayana Buddhist thought: the Yogacarin ‘store consciousness’
(dlaya-vijfiana) and the notion of ‘the embryo of the Buddha’
(tathdgata-garbha) or Buddha-nature, the innate capacity in all
beings to gain enlightenment. The latter concept was to prove
particularly influential in the development of certain tendencies
of East Asian Buddhist thought.

For their part the Theravadin Abhidharmikas seem to have
referred the answer to the kinds of problem we have been con-
sidering to their understanding of the consciousness process, out-
lined briefly above. Between each active consciousness process
the mind returns to a basic state of consciousness (bhavanga) that
defines a being as an individual before emerging once more in
response to some physical or mental stimulus. Thus instead of
referring the continuity of character traits and habitual tendencies

The Abhidharma 223

to a continuously present (but still always changing) underlying
state of mind, which the Sautrantikas and later the Yogacarins
tended to do, the Theravadins refer it to a continually interven-
ing state of mind.”

As a footnote to this discussion of Abhidharma problems, I
should mention the theory of one more Buddhist school, the
Pudgalavadins or ‘those who affirm the existence of the person’.
Their ideas seem to have been formed in the context of early
Abhidharma discussions of the undetermined questions, karma
and rebirth, the unconditioned, and the nature of conscious-
ness.” To some extent the ‘person’ of the Pudgalavadins might
be seen as performing an analogous function to ‘possession’,
seeds, or bhavanga. While other schools accused them of having
smuggled in an dtman or ‘self’, they vigorously denied that their
person was a ‘self’: it cannot be said to be the same or different
from the five aggregates; it is not susceptible to annihilation
nor is it eternal; in fact it is strictly ineffable (avaktavya). The
writings of the Pudgalavadins themselves hardly survive and
our knowledge of their ideas is largely based on the refutations
of other schools.” Although the affirmation of the person can
hardly be regarded as characteristic of mainstream Buddhist
thought, it is associated particularly with the Vinaya lineage
named after the monk Vatsiputra, the Vatsiputriya-Sammatiyas.
According to the Chinese pilgrim Hsiian-tsang who visited India
in the seventh century, around a quarter of the monks in India
belonged to this school. Of course, that a monk had been or-
dained into a particular ordination lineage need not have meant
that he automatically subscribed to the doctrinal positions asso-
ciated with that ordination lineage. Not all monks ordained
as Sammatiyas need have been pudgalavadins, just as not all
Sarvastivadin monks need necessarily have been sarvastivadins.
This last point is aptly illustrated by the fact that the contem-
porary Tibetan monks are ordained in the tradition of the
Milasarvastivadins (a sub-school of the ancient Sarvastivada),
yet none would subscribe to the view that dharmas exist in the
three times.

The Mahayana
The Great Vehicle

The beginnings of the Mahayana

The production of Buddhist siitras or texts claiming to be ‘the
word of the Buddha’ is something that continued for many cen-
turies after the death of the Buddha. Although different schools
of Buddhism gradually developed a sense of defined collections
of scriptures having the authority of the word of the Buddha, the
notion of a fixed canon seems to have remained somewhat loose.
As the history of Theravada Buddhism in Sri Lanka and South-
East Asia illustrates, even where there exists a defined canon it
is quite possible for ‘non-canonical’ siitras to continue to circulate
and be used.' But around the beginning of the Christian era there
began to emerge scriptures that challenged certain established
Buddhist teachings and ways of understanding, and which advo-
cated what is represented as a superior path of practice leading
to a superior understanding.

The defining idea of the vision of Buddhist teaching presented
in these siitras is one that I outlined at the end of Chapter 1: the
superiority of Gautama’s awakening to that of his disciples.
Gautama’s awakening is characterized by the perfect develop-
ment of all spiritual qualities, and as such it exceeds the accom-
plishment of his disciples. The path followed by Gautama is thus
the mahd-ydna—the ‘great vehicle’—or the vehicle of the Bod-
hisattva (bodhisattva-yana) ending in the perfect awakening of the
fully awakened samyak-sambuddha as opposed to ‘the inferior
vehicle’ (hina-ydna), the vehicle of the disciple (sravaka-yana),
ending in arhatship.

The dating of the earliest Mahayana siitras, like that of all ancient
Indian texts, is extremely problematic. The earliest firm date we

The Mahayana 225

have for their existence is the late second century cz when
a number of Mahayana sitras were translated into Chinese
by Lokaksema. Many Mahayana siitras as we have them show
evidence of a particular kind of literary history: an older core
text is expanded and elaborated; thus the sitras translated by
Lokaksema originated possibly a century or so earlier in India.
Most scholars push the date of the earliest Mahayana sitras back
into the first century BcE, but the production and elaboration of
Mahayana sitras certainly continued for a number of centuries.
For their part, however, the Mahayana sitras present them-
selves as teachings which, having been originally delivered by the
Buddha himself, were not taught until the time was ripe.

Modern scholars have sometimes sought to connect their
production with particular areas of India (either the south or the
north-west), but the evidence is problematic and inconclusive.
Following the lead of certain later Mahayana writers themselves,
some modern scholars have also sometimes traced the origins
of the siitras to a particular school of the ancient Sangha, namely
the Mahasamghikas; but more recent scholarship tends to stress
the fact that Mahayana was not in origin a sectarian movement.
Rather than causing a schism within the Sangha, Mahayana teach-
ings were esoteric teachings of interest to small groups of monks
from various of the ancient schools (see above pp. 56-8). Again,
while earlier scholarship has tended to represent Mahayana as
a movement inspired by popular lay religiosity and stiipa wor-
ship, more recent scholarship has suggested that we might see
the origins of the Mahayana in the activity of forest-dwelling ascetic
monks attempting to return to the ideals of original Buddhism.”
Other writers have also connected the rise of the Mahayana with
a growing cult of the book.

The most important Mahayana sutras can be conveniently
grouped according to the characteristic ideas they expound:

e Sitras setting out the stages of the bodhisattva path: the
Bodhisattva-pitaka, the DaSabhimika Siitra.

¢ The ‘perfection of wisdom’ (prajfd-paramita) sitras. These
are among the earliest Mahayana siitras, and of these the

226

The Mahayana

earliest is probably the Astasahasrika or ‘Perfection of Wis-
dom in 8,000 Lines’. The characteristic teaching is the ‘empti-
ness’ of dharmas.

The ‘ideas only’ (vijfapti-matra) siitras. These siitras intro-
duce the idealist doctrine that the ‘mind’, ‘ideas’ or ‘informa-
tion’ (vijnapti) alone is real. The most important early siitra
is the Samdhinirmocana Siitra but its teachings along with
associated theories are found developed in the next group
of sitras.

The ‘embryo of the Tathagata’ (tathagatagarbha) sitras: the
Tathagatagarbha Sutra, Mahaparinirvana Siitra, Lankavatara
Sutra, Srimaladevi-simhandda Sutra.

Two siitras of particular importance in East Asian Bud-
dhism are the Saddharmapundarika Sitra (‘Discourse of the
Lotus of the True Dharma’, commonly referred to simply
as the ‘Lotus Siitra’), which expounds the notion of the ‘one
vehicle’ (see p. 228), and the (Buddha-) Avatamsaka Siitra
(incorporating the Gandavyiiha and Dasabhimika Sitras),
which develops the notion of the ‘interpenetration of all
phenomena’ (see pp. 264-5).

The ‘pure land’ sitras: the smaller and larger Sukhavati-vyiiha
Sitras, the Amitayur-dhyana Sitra. These sitras describe the
‘pure land’ of the Buddha of Boundless Light and become
the basis for the Pure Land school of East Asian Buddhism.
Meditation siitras: Pratyutpanna-buddha-sammukhavasthita-
samadhi Siitra, Samadhi-raja Siitra, Stirangama-samadhi Siitra.
These sitras describe particular meditation practices.

Such a list indicates only in outline the nature and scope of a few
of the most important Mahayana sutras. Let us now turn to the
summary exposition of the ideas articulated in these sittras and
the related expository manuals or Sastras.

The vehicle of the bodhisattva

That all Buddhism has a bodhisattva path follows from the fact
that all Buddhism knows the story of the ascetic variously named
as Megha (in the Mahavastu) or Sumedha (in Pali sources) and

The Mahayana 227

his meeting with a previous buddha, Dipamkara. Megha could
have chosen to become a disciple of Dipamkara and followed
the path to awakening, and thus become an arhat in that very
life. If he had done so that would have been the end of the mat-
ter: there would have been no Gautama Buddha, only the arhat
Megha. But he did not follow the path to immediate arhatship;
instead he chose to practise the perfections (paramita/parami)
and so eventually—many, many lifetimes, many, many aeons later
—he became the samyaksam-buddha, Gautama. The reason for
Megha’s decision is that he was inspired by the compassionate
ideal of the bodhisattva path: having become awakened him-
self, he would lead others to awakening.‘ The traditional notion
of the arhat is that he becomes awakened and then effectively dis-
appears from samsara; the bodhisattva, on the other hand, spends
many aeons in samsiara perfecting spiritual qualities, and, in the
process, working for the benefit of sentient beings; eventually
he becomes a fully awakened buddha, but only when the teach-
ing of the previous buddha has disappeared from the world. In
choosing the path of the bodhisattva, Megha thus forgoes his
own immediate release from suffering, as an arhat, in order to
become a buddha and teach the path to the cessation of suffer-
ing to other beings.

This basic distinction between the career of the disciple and
the career of the bodhisattva is thus presupposed by all Buddhist
thought. But the earlier tradition tends to emphasize that as
far as the fundamental liberating knowledge of the four noble
truths is concerned the Buddha and his disciples are equal. But
a gap between the Buddha and arhat none the less exists. We
can trace in Buddhist literature generally an increasing tendency
to exalt the figure of the Buddha and to dwell on the description
of his incomparable virtues and superhuman powers; lists such
as the ten powers of the Tathagata and the eighteen special qual-
ities of a Buddha are common to all Buddhist schools. But with
a text such as the Lokdnuvartand Sitra (‘discourse on con-
forming to the world’) the Buddha is seen less and less as a his-
torical personality and more and more as a transcendent being
who merely appears to conform to the conventions of worldly

228 The Mahayana

existence. And the more this happens, the greater the opportun-
ity for the suggestion that the attainments of his arhat disciples
fall somewhat short of the complete awakening of the Buddha.
What is characteristic of the Mahayana vision of Buddhism is the
view that the attainment of the disciple falls so far short of full
Buddhahood that it cannot be considered as a worthy spiritual
goal; contrary to the traditional formula which states the arhat
‘has done what has to be done’, he or she in fact has further work
to do. Thus for the earlier tradition, as for the Theravada today,
the normal route to awakening was considered the path of
arhatship, and the heroic path of the bodhisattva an option for
the few.° The parting of the two ways of the bodhisattva and
Sravaka is illustrated by the traditional story of Megha. For the
Mahayana, however, the path to arhatship appears tainted with
a residual selfishness since it lacks the motivation of the great
compassion (mahdakarund@) of the bodhisattva, and ultimately the
only legitimate way of Buddhist practice is the bodhisattva path.

The traditions of Indian Buddhism that resisted the Mahayana
vision continued to think in terms of three approaches to what
was essentially one and the same final release from suffering,
nirvana: the path of the Srdvaka or ‘disciple’ leading to arhat-
ship, the path of the pratyeka-buddha and the path of the bod-
hisattva leading to the attainment of the samyak-sambuddha
(see above, pp. 32-4). The Mahay4na siitras express two basic
attitudes to this.” The first is that the path of the disciple and the
path of the pratyeka-buddha do lead to a kind of awakening, a
release from suffering, nirvana, and as such are real goals. These
goals are, however, inferior and should be renounced for the
superior attainment of buddhahood. The second attitude, clas-
sically articulated by the Lotus Siitra, sees the goal of the dis-
ciple and the pratyeka-buddha as not true goals at all.* The fact
that the Buddha taught them is an example of his ‘skill in means’
(updya-kauSalya) as a teacher.? These goals are thus merely
clever devices (updya) employed by the Buddha in order to get
beings to at least begin the practice of the path; eventually their
practice must lead on to the one and only vehicle (eka-yana) that
is the mahayana, the vehicle ending in perfect buddhahood.

The Mahayana 229

From this perspective the difference between hinaydna and
mahayana is effectively the difference between progressive stages
of the same path. This kind of understanding is expressed in the
classic Tibetan presentations of ‘the gradual path’ (Jam rim) to
awakening.'° Thus even ‘Mahayanists’ (people who accept the
Mahayana vision) do not necessarily begin their spiritual prac-
tice with the motivation of the bodhisattva simply established in
their hearts; they must first undertake various practices in order
to arouse and cultivate this motivation in the form of ‘the mind
of awakening’ (bodhi-citta): spiritual practice begins by letting
go of the delights of this world, by arousing a sense of the pain
and suffering of samsara and desiring release; it is only then that
the motivation of the bodhisattva becomes crucial.'' That is to
say, at the beginning of the path we are almost inevitably prim-
arily motivated by the wish to rid ourselves of our own individual
suffering; it is only as we progress along the path that we come
to understand that, in fact, suffering is above all something that
beings share in common; with the dawning of this realization we
are moved by compassion and the desire to help others; our moti-
vation for following the path shifts and we enter the Mahayana
proper. The bodhisattva thus at once turns away from samsara
as a place of suffering and at the same time turns back towards
it out of compassion for the suffering of the world:

And he who hopes for the welfare of the world thinks to himself: Let
me undertake religious practice, that I may bring welfare and happiness
to all beings. And he sees the aggregates (skandha) as like a magic show,
but he does not wish to disown the aggregates; he sees the senses
(dhatu) as like a poisonous serpent, but he does not wish to disown the
senses; he sees sensory awareness (dyatana) as like an empty village,
but he does not wish to disown sensory awareness.'”

The Mahayana texts may emphasize that the motivation of the
bodhisattva is quite different from that of the sravaka or dis-
ciple, but in practice the two paths are not so different: one de-
velops essentially the same spiritual qualities, but to the perfect
degree of a buddha. The bodhisattva’s practice, like the Sravaka’s,
consists of the development of good conduct, concentration, and

230 The Mahayana

wisdom: he stills the mind by means of calm meditation and then
turns the mind to insight. A new scheme of ten stages or levels
(bhimi) of the bodhisattva path, as set out in such texts as the
Dasabhimika (‘On the Ten Levels’), is superimposed on the older
map of five paths (see Table 7 above), giving a scheme of thirteen
spiritual stages. As I have just indicated, the bodhisattva path is
seen as beginning with a series of meditations aimed at arousing
the ‘awakening mind’ (bodhi-citta). What is meant here is the
arousing and establishing in one’s heart of a genuine desire to
become a buddha, and this is brought about by an awareness of
the sufferings of beings. As a result one is truly affected by their
anguish and deeply moved by compassion. The arousing and estab-
lishing of bodhi-citta correspond to the paths of equipment and
application, and are thus spiritual attainments of some depth.
With the ‘path of seeing’—the point, on the path of the sravaka,
at which one became a stream-attainer—one has reached the
first of the ten levels of the bodhisattva path and begun the de-
velopment of the six perfections (paramita): generosity (dana),
good conduct (Sila), patient acceptance (ksanti), vigour (virya),
meditation (dhyana), wisdom (prajfia). This standard list of six
perfections is correlated with the first six levels; an additional four
perfections of skill in means (updya-kauSalya), determination
(pranidhana), strength (bala), and knowledge (jfdna), are then
related to the final four levels. The practice of all ten perfections
constitutes ‘the path of development’ ending in the tenth level,
the ‘Cloud of Dharma’, and the attainment of buddhahood; beyond
is the path of ‘one in need of no further training’, a buddha."

Thus whereas from the non-Mahay4na perspective the path
of seeing is the point at which the meditator sees the four truths
directly and attains ‘the stream’ that ends in arhatship, from the
perspective of the Mahayana path this path of insight is the point
of establishing oneself on the first of ten levels that culminate in
full buddhahood.

Reaching the first level corresponds to stream-attainment; at
the sixth level the bodhisattva has reached the stage when he could
attain the nirvana of arhatship, but the journey to full buddha-
hood is not yet complete and he must pass on to the seventh level.

The Mahayana 231

The bodhisattva of these higher bhimis is a quite extraordinary
being who works ceaselessly for the benefit of all beings. Born
as god in the realms of the devas or of Brahma, he in fact already
has many of the powers and qualities of a buddha.'* Indeed
according to some sources the bodhisattva already manifests
created bodies which perform all the twelve acts of a Buddha
(see Chapter 1) at the tenth stage:

At will he displays the array of the realms of all the Buddhas at the end
of a single hair; at will he displays untold arrays of the realms of the
Buddhas of all kinds; at will in the twinkling of an eye he creates as
many individuals as there are particles in untold world-systems ... In
the arising of a thought he embraces the ten directions; in a moment
of thought he controls the manifestation of innumerable processes of
complete awakening and final nirvana ... In his own body he controls
countless manifestations of the qualities of the Buddha fields of innu-
merable Blessed Buddhas.'*

If this is what tenth-stage bodhisattvas do, then what do buddhas
do? The short answer is much, much more of the same—such
that one cannot properly begin to conceive of what buddhas truly
do. Nevertheless it appears that we are to understand that at some
point in the process—the repeated process of manifesting the
acts of buddhas and carrying out their work—these tenth-stage
bodhisattvas do actually become buddhas. But for the Mahayana
buddhahood this final attainment occurs in the Akanistha (Pali
Akanittha) realm, the highest of ‘the Pure Abodes’ (see above
p- 118).

Transcendent buddhas

In the earlier tradition the Tathagata, or ‘the one who has gone
thus’, teaches the Dharma and at death attains parinirvana or
‘final nirvana’. Although after death he strictly cannot be said to
exist, not exist, both exist and not exist, or neither exist nor not
exist, effectively he disappears from samsara never to be seen
again. The Buddha of the Mahayana, however, continues to be
present and in some way active. Strictly, for all Buddhism, we
cannot speak of a buddha as ‘existing’ in any ordinary sense, since

232 The Mahayana

to exist in an ordinary sense means to be born as an individual
being in a particular realm; Buddhas have precisely transcended
the round of rebirth, so cannot be said to exist at a particular
time and place as ‘individuals’. For the Mahayana becoming a
Buddha generally involves attaining what is characterized as
the ‘unestablished’ or ‘non-abiding’ (apratisthita) nirvana: on the
one hand the knowledge of a buddha that sees emptiness, is
not ‘established’ in samsara (by seizing on birth as an individual
being, for example), on the other hand the great compassion of
a buddha prevents the complete turning away from samsara. So
ultimately he abides neither in samsara nor in nirvana.'® Thus,
while it may appear that a buddha takes birth as an individual
being like the rest of us, in truth he does not. What we ordinarily
see here on earth, as it were, is merely a body created by the
Buddha, a nirmana-kaya. Where is the Buddha really?

In the process of following the path the bodhisattva gradually
develops the ability to magically transform himself and the
world around him for the benefit of beings. The Indian yogic and
meditation theory generally recognizes the development of vari-
ous powers (see pp. 185-6), but in the context of the development
of the bodhisattva path the ability is perfected and becomes of
a different order. In a sutta in the Pali canon the Buddha is
described as having a body endowed with thirty-two marks. But
these marks are obviously not marks of the Buddha’s ordinary
body that we normally see. They are the marks of a body gradu-
ally developed over many aeons by the practice of perfections.
Again, various kinds of ‘subtle bodies’ are universal to Indian
meditation theory. For the yogin his other body (even if more
subtle), developed and experienced in the stages of meditation,
comes to be more real than his ordinary physical body. So there
is a sense in which the yogin gradually becomes this other body.
For the bodhisattva the end point of this development is the ‘enjoy-
ment body’ (sambhoga-kaya) of a buddha teaching the Dharma
in a ‘buddha-field’ (buddha-ksetra). This enjoyment body is closer
to what a buddha really is and may, indeed, be seen by some; for
the rest of us, we must be content with the grosser manifestations
of the Buddha’s bodies of magical creation (nirmdna-kdya). Yet

The Mahayana 233

the enjoyment body is, again hardly what the Buddha ultimately
is. What a buddha is in ‘himself’ is the dharma-kdaya. This expres-
sion originally seems to have meant that a buddha is ultimately
the sum (kaya) of perfected good qualities (dharma) that consti-
tute a Buddha. But the expression comes to be interpreted, at
any rate in the Yogacara tradition, as referring to the ultimate
truth of the way things are: the eternal, unchanging truth per-
ceived by a buddha, ‘thusness’ (tathata).'’ Buddhas in the world,
nirmana-kayas, come and go, live and die, as Gautama did in the
fifth century BCE; cosmic buddhas, sambhoga-kayas, spend count-
less aeons teaching in their pure lands and manifesting nirmana-
kayas; strictly dharma-kayas do not do anything at all.

For the earlier non-Mahayana tradition there can only be one
buddha at any given time and we must wait until his teaching has
disappeared for the next to arise. Previous buddhas, although
recognized and the object of devotions and rituals, are, like the
Buddha Gautama, doctrinally at least beings of the past rather
than the present.'* Maitreya (Pali Metteyya), universally acknow-
ledged as the bodhisattva who will become the next buddha, must
already be far advanced along the path, but his time is yet to come.
For the Mahayana all this changes; the notion of the sambhoga-
kaya is developed and exploited, emphasizing that there must,
in the infinite universe, be buddhas now teaching in their pure
lands and buddha-fields.'? These buddhas—the ‘unshakeable’
Aksobhya, the ‘medicine’ Buddha Bhaisajya Guru, the bound-
less radiance of Amitabha—and their lovely pure lands are
accessible to us, through either meditation or rebirth. Moreover
the Mahayana conception allows that numerous advanced bod-
hisattvas are now working for the benefit of beings—not only
Maitreya, but also Avalokitesvara, the lord who looks down with
compassion, the charming Maiijusri, bodhisattva of wisdom, and
the ‘saviouress’ Tara.” Indeed, according to the Lotus Sitra,
Gautama, Sakyamuni Buddha, is still around.

The development of the worship of various buddhas and
bodhisattvas is a feature of Mahayana Buddhist practice, and it
continues especially in East Asian Pure Land Buddhism and
in Tibetan Buddhism. Yet this development can be seen as a

234 The Mahayana

continuation of the practice of the recollection and visualization
of the Buddha and his qualities (buddhanusmrti/buddhanussati),
and the contrast with contemporary Theravadin attitudes can
be overstated. While the Theravadin doctrinal position on the
ontological status of the Buddha and arhats of the past (which,
we should remember, includes the stricture that we should not
say that they do not exist) remains, in practice the power of the
Buddha Gautama is thought of as somehow persisting until
the final disappearance of all his relics, which, it is thought, in
the last days of the Dharma will spontaneously come together
at the site of the Buddha’s awakening and vanish (the tradition
of dhatu-parinibbana).”| The devotional cult of arhats is anci-
ent, and the presence of the arhats is invoked in South-East
Asia, and one whom many regarded as a twentieth-century arhat,
Ajahn Mun, is described as meeting and conversing with the arhats
of the past.”

Emptiness (sunyata) and the ‘perfection of wisdom’
(prajhaparamita)

Mahayana sitras see the motivation underlying the arhat’s attain-
ment as lacking the great compassion (mahda-karuna) of a buddha;
of equal concern to the siitras is perfect wisdom. Together, wis-
dom and compassion become the two great themes of Mahayana
thought.

The ‘Perfection of Wisdom’ (prajfdaparamita) literature
evolved over many centuries and comprises a variety of texts,
including some of the oldest Mahayana sitra material. Edward
Conze, a pioneer of the scholarly study of this literature, con-
sidered the oldest and most basic text to be the Astasahasrika-
Prajnaparamita (‘Perfection of Wisdom in 8,000 Lines’), which
he dates from the first century BCE. Subsequent centuries saw the
production of vast expanded versions, such as those of 100,000
lines, 25,000 lines, and 18,000 lines, as well as shorter versions,
such as the Vajracchedika and Hrdaya (the ‘Diamond’ and
‘Heart’ Sitras), although it now appears that the last, a text only

The Mahayana 235

a few lines in length, was originally composed in Chinese and only
subsequently rendered into Sanskrit.”

In the century or so prior to the appearance of the Perfection
of Wisdom literature, Buddhism had, in the form of Abhidharma,
begun to evolve increasingly detailed and sophisticated theor-
etical accounts of the nature of reality and of the stages of the
path to awakening. Central to the Abhidharma is the distinction
between the conventional truth (that persons and selves exist)
and the ultimate truth (that persons and selves are ultimately
simply aggregates of evanescent dharmas—physical and mental
events). The main teaching of the Perfection of Wisdom is that,
from the perspective of perfect wisdom, even this account of the
way things are is ultimately arbitrary.

Since we fail to see things as they really are—impermanent,
suffering, and not self—we grasp at them as if they were per-
manent, as if they could bring us lasting happiness, as if we
could possess them as our very own. Thus the cultivation of calm
and insight involves breaking up the seemingly substantial and
enduring appearance of things. Things—our very own selves, our
own minds—are actually nothing but insubstantial, evanescent
dharmas (see above, p. 190). Abhidharma theory and the asso-
ciated meditations thus provide a way of getting behind appear-
ances to a world that is quite different from the one ordinarily
experienced—a way of easing the mind from the ways and pat-
terns of thought it habitually uses to understand the world. So far
so good, but the currents of craving run deep, and the habitual
ways and patterns of thought are subtle and devious. Our minds
have a predilection to the formulation of views (drsti/ditthi), to
conceptual proliferation (prapanca/papainca), and to the manu-
facture of conceptual constructs (vikalpa); it is these which we
tend to confuse with the way things are and to which we become
attached. In other words, we are always in danger of mistaking
our own views and opinions for a true understanding of the way
things are. This danger—and this is the really significant point—
may apply to views and opinions based on the theoretical teachings
of Buddhism (the Abhidharma and the account of the stages
of the path) no less than to views and opinions derived from

236 The Mahayana

other theoretical systems. Perfect wisdom, however, is what sees
through the process of the mind’s conceptual construction and
is not tainted by attachment to any view or opinion. In particu-
lar, it is not attached to the views and conceptual constructs
of Buddhist theory: unwholesome and wholesome qualities, the
levels of meditation or dhyana, the stages of insight, the attain-
ment of the Buddhist path, nirvana itself, the general theory of
dharmas. From the perspective of perfect wisdom all these are
seen for what they ultimately are: empty (Stinya/sufina). That
is, the conceptual constructs of Buddhist theory are ultimately
no less artificial and arbitrary entities than the conceptual con-
structs of the ordinary unawakened mind which sees really exist-
ing persons and selves. The mind can grasp at the theory of dharmas
and turn it into another conceptual strait-jacket. Thus the Large
Sitra can state that:

there is no ignorance and no cessation of ignorance . . . no suffering and
no knowledge of suffering, no cause and no abandoning of the cause,
no cessation and no realization of cessation, and no path and no devel-
opment of the path . . . It is in this sense, Sariputra, that a bodhisattva,
a great being who practises perfect wisdom, is called one devoted [to
perfect wisdom].

The teaching of emptiness should not be read, as it sometimes
appears to be, as an attempt to subvert the Abhidharma theory
of dharmas as a whole. After all it applies to the constructs of all
Buddhist theory, including the Mahayana and, crucially, itself:
there are no bodhisattvas and no stages of the bodhisattva path.
Two points are of importance here. First, we are concerned here
with the perfection of wisdom, how the world is seen by the
awakened mind. Secondly the perfection of wisdom texts pre-
sent what they have to say about wisdom not as an innovation
but as a restatement of the original teaching of the Buddha.
The wisdom or understanding of ordinary beings becomes
tainted by attachment to views and conceptual construction;
this attachment manifests as a certain rigidity and inflexibility of
mind; the perfect wisdom of a buddha is free of all attachment
and clinging. In carving up reality into dharmas in the manner
of the Abhidharma, we are essentially constructing a theoretical

The Mahayana 237

‘model’ or map of the way things are. Like any model or map,
it may be useful and indeed help us to understand the way things
are. In a provisional or conventional way, it may actually corres-
pond to the way things are. Some maps and models will reflect
the way things are better than others, but they nevertheless
remain models and maps. As such, none should be mistaken for
the way things are. Thus for the Perfection of Wisdom, just as
persons and beings are ultimately elusive entities, so too are all
dharmas. In fact the idea that anything exists of and in itself is a
simply a trick that our minds and language play on us.

The great theme of the Perfection of Wisdom thus becomes
‘emptiness’ (Siinyata/sunnata)—the emptiness of all things that
we might be tempted to think truly and ultimately exist of and
in themselves. To see any dharma as existing in itself is to grasp
at it, to try to hold on to it, but dharmas are like dreams, magical
illusions, echoes, reflected images, mirages, space; like the moon
reflected in water, a fairy castle, a shadow, or a magical creation;
like the stars, dewdrops, a bubble, a flash of lightning, or a cloud
—they are there, but they are not there, and if we reach out for
them, we find nothing to hold on to.% Some of these similes and
images are older than the Perfection of Wisdom, and in refer-
ring and adding to them the literature is not so much suggesting
that the theory of dharmas is wrong as that it must be under-
stood correctly.”

The term ‘emptiness’ is not new to the Perfection of Wisdom
literature; it is already employed, albeit somewhat loosely and
only occasionally, in the Nikayas/Agamas and the canonical
Abhidharma texts to characterize the experiences of meditation,
and the five aggregates and dharmas.”’ But the emphasis on per-
fect wisdom as that which understands emptiness becomes the
hallmark of the Perfection of Wisdom literature and its philo-
sophical explication by Nagarjuna.

Nagarjuna and the ‘middle’ (Madhyamaka) school

Nagarjuna, who probably lived in the second century cE, is
the father of the Madhyamaka or ‘middle’ school of Buddhist

238 The Mahayana

philosophy. The Madhyamaka was to become one of the two
great philosophical traditions of the Mahayana, but lest there be
confusion let me remind the reader that a philosophical school
of thought is quite a distinct matter from a division and group-
ing of the monastic Sangha (nikaya); in India the Madhyamaka
was not and never becomes a school in the sense of the
Mahasamghika, Theravada, Sarvastivada, or Sammatiya. In fact,
as a Buddhist monk, Nagarjuna was presumably ordained into
one of these four main ordination lineages, though which is not
known, and remained in that tradition for the rest of his monas-
tic life. The Madhyamaka was a philosophical outlook that, like
the Mahayana in general, would have crossed the boundaries of
the various ordination lineages of the Sangha.

This philosophical school is named after Nagarjuna’s prin-
cipal work, Miila-Madhyamaka-Karika or ‘Root Verses on the
Middle’, and refers to the way in which Nagarjuna presents
‘emptiness’ as equivalent to that fundamental teaching of the
Buddha, ‘dependent arising’, and, as such, as articulating the
‘middle’ between the extremes of eternalism and annihilation-
ism. If something arises in dependence upon some other thing,
as a dharma is supposed to, then how, Nagarjuna asks, can it be
defined in the manner that certain Abhidharma theorists want,
as that which exists of and in itself, as that which possesses its
own existence (svabhava/sabhava)? For if something is suf-
ficient to explain its own existence, then it must exist as itself for
ever and ever, and could never be affected by anything else, since
as soon as it was affected it would cease to be itself. And if things
cannot truly change, then the whole of Buddhism is undermined,
for Buddhism claims that suffering arises because of causes
and conditions and that by gradually eliminating unwholesome
conditions and cultivating wholesome conditions we can change
from being unawakened to being awakened. Thus the one who
claims that dharmas ultimately exist in themselves must either
fall into the trap of eternalism by denying the possibility of real
change, or, if he nevertheless insists that change is possible, fall
into the trap of annihilationism since, in changing, what existed
has gone out of existence. Therefore, concludes Nagarjuna, the

The Mahayana 239

teaching of the Buddha is that everything is empty of its own
inherent existence.

But Nagarjuna was quick to point out that we should not con-
clude that emptiness itself is equivalent to the view that nothing
exists; in fact those who see in emptiness some kind of annihila-
tionism have a faulty view of emptiness, and ‘when it is wrongly
seen, emptiness destroys the dull-witted, like a snake that is
wrongly grasped or a magical spell that is wrongly cast’.* It is
not that nothing exists, but that nothing exists as an individual
essence possessed of its own inherent existence. In particular, to
see ‘emptiness’ as undermining the teaching of the Buddha is to
fail to take proper account of the basic Abhidharma distinction
between conventional truth and ultimate truth. The point is that,
for Nagarjuna, the Abhidharma account of the world in terms
of dharmas cannot be the ultimate description of the way things
are; rather it still falls within the compass of conventional truth.
The ultimate truth about the way things are is emptiness, but
conventional truth is still truth, not conventional falsehood, and
without it the Buddha’s teaching is hopeless:

The buddhas’ teaching of Dharma depends equally on two truths: ordin-
ary conventional truth and truth from the point of view of the ultimate;
those who do not perceive the difference between these two truths do
not perceive the deep ‘reality’ (tattva) in the teaching of the buddhas.
Without resorting to ordinary conventions, what is ultimate cannot be
taught; without recourse to what is ultimate, nirvana is not attained.”

But nirvana is not some ‘Absolute Reality’ existing beyond the
phenomenal conditioned world, behind the veil of conventional
truth, for again this would commit us to eternalism. Emptiness
is the ultimate truth of reality and of nirvana—it too is empty of
its own existence, it is not an existent. It follows that nirvana can-
not be understood as some thing, some existent, which is other
than the conditioned round of existence, samsara:

There is nothing that distinguishes samsara from nirvana; there is noth-
ing that distinguishes nirvana from samsara; and the furthest limit of
nirvana is also the furthest limit of samsara; not even the subtlest dif-
ference between the two is found.

240 The Mahayana

In emptiness, then, Nagarjuna attempts to articulate very pre-
cisely what he sees as the Buddha’s teaching of dependent aris-
ing and the middle between annihilationism and eternalism:
emptiness is not a ‘nothing’, it is not nihilism, but equally it is
not a ‘something’, it is not some absolute reality; it is the abso-
lute truth about the way things are but it is not the Absolute.
For to think of emptiness in terms of either an Absolute or a
Nothingness is precisely to turn emptiness into a view of either
eternalism or of annihilationism. But in fact the Buddha taught
Dharma for the abandoning of all views and emptiness is pre-
cisely the letting go of all views, while those for whom emptiness
is a view are ‘incurable’.*!

Tibetan tradition has identified two basic schools of thought
in the history of Madhyamaka in India after Nagarjuna. The first
is the prasangika or method ‘of consequences’, exemplified
by Buddhapalita (sixth century) and Candrakirti. This involves
drawing out the undesirable and contradictory consequences
that follow from attempting to take up a philosophical position
on some issue. The classic form of this method amounts to a kind
of reductio ad absurdum of four possibilities (catus-koti), that
something is the case, is not the case, both is and is not the case,
neither is nor is not the case. All four are shown to be unten-
able, and ‘emptiness’ follows directly from this. Thus, for example,
chapter 12 of Nagarjuna’s Mila-Madhyamaka-Karika tries to
demonstrate the incoherence of maintaining that suffering is
produced by oneself, that it is produced by another, that it is
produced by both oneself and another, that it is produced by
neither. The method is thus primarily negative, there being no
attempt to adduce independent (svatantrika) positive arguments
aimed at establishing the philosophical ‘position’ of emptiness.
This alternative svatantrika method is associated with the name
of Bhavaviveka (sixth century).

The term ‘view’ (drsti/ditthi) becomes crucial for the Perfec-
tion of Wisdom and Nagarjuna. The Nikayas and Agamas dis-
tinguished between ‘wrong’ view (e.g. that our actions have no
results, that the self exists) and ‘right’ views (e.g. that actions do
have results and that all things are not self) and recommend the

The Mahayana 241

latter. At the same time these early Buddhist texts stress that the
arhat transcends and is free of all views and opinions. What the
Perfection of Wisdom and Nagarjuna are concerned to articu-
late is that there is a level at which views in general—even ‘right’
ones—should be seen as a form of mental rigidity, a form of
opinionatedness: that is, we become attached to our right under-
standing. Thus the awakened mind is free of all views—even right
views; it simply sees that dharmas are empty, it simply sees the
way things are; the unawakened mind grasps at or fixes upon
particular conceptual understandings or verbal expressions. This
does not mean that ‘right’ views are somehow wrong, only that
theoretical understanding should not be confused with real see-
ing. Right views and opinions are ultimately merely devices to
bring about perfect understanding itself; the theory is for the sake
of understanding. That is, a buddha cannot strictly be said to hold
the view, opinion, or belief that all dharmas are empty; strictly
speaking he does not hold any views or opinions, he simply sees
the way things are. That is, the mind that sees emptiness (as
opposed to the mind that merely has a theoretical grasp) is free
of any tendency to impose some sort of conceptual construct
on the way things are. On the other hand, although we may be
convinced by Nagarjuna’s argument and form the view that it is
certainly true that all things are empty of inherent existence,
nothing actually changes for us and our minds continue to grasp
at objects of experience, whether physical or emotional, as if they
were so many possessions to have or to reject.

Like the Prajiiaparamita in general, Nagarjuna’s analysis has
often been presented in modern scholarly discussions as subverting
the whole Abhidharma enterprise. This is to simplify Nagarjuna
to the point of distortion. Nagarjuna’s discussion is couched in
Abhidharma technical terminology and assumes a thorough
understanding of Abhidharma principles of analysis. Nagarjuna
is not attempting to show that Abhidharma is somehow wrong,
just as he is not attempting to show that the four noble truths,
or any of the other categories of Buddhist teaching, are wrong.
Rather Nagarjuna is concerned with a particular Abhidharma issue,
namely the ontology of a ‘dharma’: how is one to define what a

242 The Mahayana

‘dharma’ is? What he wants to point out, by appeal to funda-
mental principles that all Buddhist thought takes for granted,
is that a ‘dharma’ certainly cannot be defined as that which pos-
sesses its own inherent existence (as opposed to the conven-
tional existence of the ‘self’, for example). An account of reality
in terms of ultimately real, self-existent dharmas cannot have
the status of ultimate truth but only conventional truth. In as much
as it presents dharmas as representing the ultimate divisions
in the analysis of experience, beyond which one cannot go, all
Abhidharma tended to define dharmas as those things which
exist in themselves (svabhava/sabhava). Nagarjuna’s point is
that, on Buddhist principles, such ultimate divisions of analysis
are always arbitrary and cannot be taken as referring to ultimate
realities in themselves. Although he is not explicit, in presenting
his critique of dharmas as ‘self-existents’, he seems to have in
mind particularly the kind of ontology of a dharma we know
from the works of the Sarvastivada-Vaibhasika Abhidharma.”
This lays great stress on dharmas as the ultimate ‘substantial bits’
(dravya) of mentality or materiality out of which the world as a
whole is constructed. For Nagarjuna an account of the world in
Abhidharma terms is perfectly legitimate, as long as we do not
view it as an exact and final description of how things are; like
the Buddha’s teachings generally, Abhidharma must ultimately
be seen as ‘conventional’, taught for the purpose of the aban-
doning of greed, hatred, and delusion.*

The Perfection of Wisdom literature is Mahayanist in so far
as it privileges the path of the bodhisattva; likewise, on the evid-
ence of the other writings usually attributed to him, the author
of the Mila-Madhyamaka-Karika seems to have been a follower
of the Mahayana. But if Nagarjuna is a Mahayanist, this fact
is entirely incidental to the philosophy of the Madhyamaka-
Karika. In seeking to establish his understanding of emptiness,
he appeals not to the authority of the Perfection of Wisdom Sutras,
but to that of the discourses of the Buddha on dependent arising
preserved in the ancient Samyukta division of the canon.™ In fact
neither the early Perfection of Wisdom sitras nor Nagarjuna seem
to present their understanding of ‘emptiness’ as a teaching pecu-

The Mahayana 243

liar to the Mahayana; that is, the understanding of emptiness of
all dharmas is not seen as exclusive to bodhisattvas and buddhas
but as the wisdom common to Sravakas, pratyeka-buddhas and
buddhas. Certainly this is how Candrakirti, Nagarjuna’s seventh-
century commentator, understood the matter. Thus for the Per-
fection of Wisdom and for Nagarjuna, ‘the emptiness of dharmas’
(dharma-Siinyata) is not a further teaching, but something required
by the logic of ‘the emptiness of persons’ (pudgala-Stinyata). Self
(atman) and ‘inherent existence’ (svabhdva) are equivalents, only
the scale is different: the doctrine that there is no substantial
self underlying persons (pudgala-nairatmya) entails the doctrine
that there is no substantial self underlying dharmas (dharma-
nairatmya); just as there is no ultimate unchanging ‘thing’ behind
the label ‘person’ or ‘self’, so there is no ultimate, unchanging
thing behind the labels ‘greed’, ‘hatred’, or ‘ignorance’, behind
the labels ‘non-attachment’, ‘loving kindness’, and ‘wisdom’.
And this is what arhats and buddhas have always seen. Some
Mahayana writers, however, did want to claim the understanding
of the emptiness of dharmas as the preserve of the bodhisattva:
arhats understand the emptiness of persons and thereby re-
move the obstacles that consist in the defilements (klesa-dvarana),
but only buddhas understand the emptiness of dharmas and
remove all the obstacles to full knowledge (jfieya-dvarana). Thus
although they abandon the defilements, arhats are still subject
to subtle traces left by the defilements (klesa-vadsana), which can
cause, for example, an arhat to skip like a monkey, echoing a
previous life.%°

Both the Perfection of Wisdom and Nagarjuna understand
themselves as explicating an understanding of the Buddha’s teach-
ing as originally taught by the Buddha, and in certain respects
such a view of the matter may not be entirely unhistorical.
The earliest Buddhist teachings place great emphasis on the
wisdom of the arhat as transcending fixed views and opinions in
a manner that is not dissimilar from the Perfection of Wisdom
and Nagarjuna. Moreover, non-Mahayana manuals that basically
subscribe to the Abhidharma outlook share in significant respects
a common understanding with the Perfection of Wisdom and

244 The Mahayana

Nagarjuna on these matters: certainly dharmas are ultimately
ungraspable and evanescent; certainly the arhat’s knowledge
transcends all views, even right views.*°

Of all Buddhist thinkers, it is Nagarjuna who has repeatedly
captured the modern imagination. Modern scholars have presented
his thought as prefiguring Kant (Stcherbatsky), Wittgenstein
(Gudmunsen), and, most recently, Rorty and Derrida (Hunting-
ton). Other scholars, such as Robinson and Hayes, have suggested
that Nagarjuna’s arguments employ a kind of logical sleight of
hand and in places are simply logically flawed.*’ Hayes has also
questioned his influence on subsequent Indian Buddhist thought,
yet he remains a towering and legendary figure for later Chinese
and, especially, Tibetan Buddhist thought.

‘Ideas-only’ (vijhapti-matra) and the Yogacara

The basic understanding of this tradition is that the world we
live in—the round of rebirth or samsara—is to be explained
in its entirety in terms of the workings of the mind: the three-
fold universe (see Chapter 5) is only ‘ideas’ (vijfapti-mdtra).*
The theories and teachings associated with this understanding
are found in various sitras, the most important being the
Samdhinirmocana (‘Unravelling the Mystery of Thought’) and
the Lankavatara (‘Arrival in Lanka’); they receive their initial
systematic exposition in the works of Asanga and Vasubandhu,
such as Asanga’s Mahaydna-Samgraha (‘Summary of the Great
Vehicle’) and Vasubandhu’s Vimsatika (‘Twenty Verses’) and
Trimsika (‘Thirty Verses’), Tri-Svabhava-Nirdesa (‘Exposition of
the Three Natures’), and his commentary to the Madhyanta-
Vibhaga (‘Analysis of the Middle Path’), a work traditionally
regarded as given, along with several others, to Asanga by the
Bodhisattva Maitreya in the Tusita heaven. The work of these
two thinkers was subsequently commented upon and elabor-
ated in India by Sthiramati (sixth century) and Dharmapala
(seventh century), and in China by Paramartha (sixth century)
and Hsiian-tsang, who studied with Dharmapala at Nalanda in
the seventh century and later wrote the Cheng-wei-shih lun or

The Mahayana 245

Vijfaptimatratasiddhi, a commentary on Vasubandhu’s Trimsika
incorporating the views of various Indian teachers.

The teachings of this school in certain respects represent a
reworking of particular Abhidharma themes in response to the
Prajfiaparamita and Madhyamaka teaching of emptiness. The
Samdhinirmocana Siitra thus presents its own teachings as a
third and definitive ‘turning of the wheel of the Dharma’, fol-
lowing the Buddha’s provisional teachings of the four truths in
the deer park outside Benares, and of emptiness in the manner
of the Prajfiaparamita.* That is, for the Samdhinirmocana, the
presentation of emptiness in the Prajfiaparamita is too prone
to the wrong sort of interpretation by the unwary and needs
further explication.

The Prajiiaparamita and Madhyamaka point out that the logic
of ‘dependent arising’ demands that dharmas cannot be thought
of as the absolute, ultimate existents of the universe. In peeling
away the conventional truth of the existence of persons and
selves and seeing the underlying dharmas, we do not arrive at
ultimate existents, but only at another, perhaps deeper layer of
conventional truth; the ultimate truth is that dharmas too are
empty of their own existence. From the Yogacara perspective,
however, this is to tell us what things are ultimately not, but it
is to tell us much too little about what things are and, crucially,
how they come to appear other than the way they are. Thus
while Madhyamaka was primarily concerned to critique a parti-
cular analysis of the ontology of a dharma, Yogacara returns to
giving a positive account of the workings of the mind in terms
of dharmas in a new ontological framework. As the name of
the school indicates—Yoga Practice—its approach is perhaps
especially based in meditation, and the writings of Asanga and
Vasubandhu show a special interest in calm meditation. There
are two basic parts to the account of mind given in Yogacara:
the first concerns the eight types of consciousness (vijfidna) and
the second the ‘three natures’ (tri-svabhdava). Let us turn to these
in turn.

Early Buddhist thought analysed consciousness as consist-
ing of six basic types corresponding to the five senses and the

246 The Mahayana

mind. Building on the traditions of the earlier Abhidharmikas,
Yogacarin thinkers give what amounts to a rather more complex
account of the sixth, mind consciousness, focusing on what are
in effect the deeper layers of the mind. The active or surface level
of the mind continues to be seen as comprising six type of con-
sciousness: our primary awareness of five types of sense data
and our conscious thoughts, which for human beings are mostly
related to the former in various ways. But underpinning these
types of active consciousness are two further types of conscious-
ness which are crucial in creating the world as we ordinarily
experience it. The first is ‘the defiled mind’ (klista-manas), so called
because it is afflicted with four basic defilements: the view of indi-
viduality, the conceit ‘I am’, clinging to self and delusion.” The
object of this defilement, what the defiled mind in some way takes
as the self, is the eighth consciousness, ‘the store consciousness’
(dlaya-vijnana)."' Below the threshold of consciousness proper,”
the store consciousness is the particular repository of all the seeds
sown by the defilements of a being’s active consciousness; it is
the result of a being’s past karma, the accumulation of all past
tendencies, strong or weak, to greed, hatred, and delusion; as such
the store consciousness is also the condition for the perpetu-
ation of these defilements in present and future active conscious-
ness; it thus continually interacts with active consciousness
according to the principles of dependent arising. Of course, the
store consciousness is not a self, a thing in itself; what, in our
subconscious, the defiled mind takes for a self is merely an
underlying mass of ever changing causes and conditions, arising
and falling, but which none the less, as it flows on, maintains a
certain pattern which gives it the appearance of relative identity.
The store consciousness is thus the underlying basis and support
(aSraya) of our conscious lives: the largely hidden heart of our
personalities.

The world of experience has three different natures (¢ri-
svabhava). Clearly something is going on: we have experiences.
The problem, according to the Yogacara, is that what we
experience is ourselves as conscious subjects enjoying a world
of objects that exist ‘out there’, independently from us. This is

The Mahayana 247

experience in its ‘imagined’ (parikalpita) nature, for the world
of experiencing subject or ‘grasper’ and experienced object or
‘thing grasped’ is in fact a world of unreal imaginings, of things
that do not ultimately exist. Both the grasper and the things grasped
are in fact ideas, pieces of information (vijfapti), thrown up by
the traces and seeds deposited in the store consciousness. This
is experience in its dependent (para-tantra) nature. The opera-
tion of the eight kinds of consciousness ultimately consists in
nothing more than a flow of ‘ideas’ (vijfapti-mdtra), arising in
dependence upon each other.“ By force of a long-standing habit
—throughout beginningless samsara—we have imagined in the
dependent flow of ‘pieces of information’ a world of independ-
ent subjects and independent objects. But when, as buddhas, we
understand the complete absence of the duality of subject and
object in the ‘dependent nature’ of experience, then experience
appears in its perfected (nispanna) nature. In crude summary,
the imagined nature is the unawakened mind, the perfected
nature is the awakened mind, while the dependent nature is the
common basis.

As the realization of the Buddhist yogin at the culmination
of the Buddhist path, the perfected nature consists in the non-
conceptual knowledge (nirvikalpaka-jfiana) which is empty of any
sense of experiencing subject and experienced object. Its attain-
ment is marked by ‘the turning around of the basis’ (asraya-
paravrtti), a revolution at the very centre of one’s being whereby
all defilements are cut off, and the imagined nature is no longer
imposed upon the dependent nature, which appears instead as
the perfected nature. As a result of this ‘turning around of the
basis’, the seeds in the store consciousness cease to function as
the basis for the imagined nature.** What appears as the contra-
diction at the heart of reality is seen through: certainly the pro-
cess of imagining the duality of subject and object exists, but since
a subject and object are not in the end to be found, the process
is empty (Siinya), and yet this ‘emptiness’ itself is something that
is definitely found. The middle way is to be found in the way ‘real-
ity’ is somehow existent, non-existent, and yet existent at the same
time. Ultimately reality is thus characterized not as an absolute

248 The Mahayana

‘something’ (either mind or matter), but simply as the way things
are: ‘thusness’ (tathata).”

Modern scholars have disagreed on the question of whether
Yogacara constitutes a true philosophical ‘idealism’, asserting that
the mind only is real and that the external material world is un-
real. The argument essentially turns, as Griffiths has neatly put
it, on the question of whether Yogacara is primarily making an
epistemological point (that all we have access to is mental rep-
resentation) or an ontological one (that mental representation
is all that exists).4”7 Certainly Yogacara starts from the premiss
that the world we know, the world we live in, is strictly a mental
world: everything comes to us in the form of ‘information’ or ‘ideas’
(vijapti). Apart from vijfapti there is no world, there is no
experience. Equally certainly it is saying more than that simply
in practice, de facto, we are trapped in our own private mental
world unable to know whether or not there is in reality an exter-
nal world that corresponds to our ideas about it, to our percep-
tions of it. Yogacara is not a doctrine of solipsism. Vasubandhu’s
VimSatika thus attempts to argue that, although objects do not
exist out there apart from our perceptions of them, nevertheless
similar past karma results in the sharing of common experiences
in the present. But these experiences are simply the products of
the workings of consciousness, amounting to the arising of sim-
ilar pieces of information in different streams of consciousness.
We are, as it were, dreaming similar dreams; and just as the pieces
of information that come to us in a dream lack independent objects,
so do the direct perceptions of our wakeful state:

Thus people are hypnotized with a sleep arising from impressions left
by the habit of false ways of thought, and, as in a dream, when they see
things that are unreal, so long as they do not wake up they do not under-
stand their non-existence. When, however, they wake up by acquiring
the transcendent knowledge which is beyond thought and opposed to
that same sleep, then, by the realization of the purified ordinary aware-
ness that is gained as a consequence, they understand the non-existence
of the objects of the senses.**

Yogacara thus does not appear to be agnostic about the nature
of the external world. Rather it claims to present an account of

The Mahayana 249

how we construct our world our of ideas, of how this causes us
suffering, and of how we can turn this process around and escape
from suffering. In other words, like all Buddhism it presents us
with an account of the four truths. Yogacara denies the ultimate
independent existence of a separate experiencing subject on the
one hand and another separate world ‘out there’ of experienced
objects. That the world appears like this is an illusion con-
structed out of consciousness; or mind. But this is not to be taken
as saying that I, the experiencing subject, somehow exist as my
mind, my consciousness, while the external world of objects does
not exist. It is precisely both that are ultimately fictions, illusions—
‘ideas’ (vijfapti) fabricated by mind. True, Yogacara privileges
‘mind’ or ‘consciousness’ in so far as it is the operation of the
mind that brings about the illusion of the duality of subject and
object. But ‘mind’ that is not an experiencer or enjoyer of ex-
ternal objects is not exactly mind as we ordinarily understand
it. For Yogacara, as for all Buddhist thought, it is the way things
are rather than what actually is, that is crucial: the truth under-
lying reality is ‘thusness’ (tathata).

In many ways Yogacara represents the culmination of the north
Indian Buddhist intellectual tradition. Its treatises set forth a full
psychological theory (which represents a reworking of earlier
Abhidharma systems), a complete map of the path (outlining in
some detail the progress of calm and insight meditation), and a
complex understanding of the nature of buddhahood. As with
all Buddhist thought, one should not be misled by the philosoph-
ical sophistication of Madhyamaka and Yogacara thought. Their
teachings are not seen as mere intellectual abstraction which to
all practical intents and purposes we can forget about. The the-
oretical content of these systems are as ever orientated towards
releasing beings from suffering. For Madhyamaka, as long as
we see a world of things that exist in themselves, we are trying,
however subtly, to hold on to things that ultimately must slip
from our grasp, and this can only cause ourselves and others suf-
fering. Likewise, for Yogacara, as long as we see the world in
terms of really existent experiencing subjects and really existing

250 The Mahayana

experienced objects, we are trapped in a world of beings grasping
at their experiences as objects of possession; once more this
will only end in more suffering for all concerned. What both
Madhyamaka and Yogacara point towards is not simply a change
of intellectual view, but a radical change of heart, deep within
ourselves. While it is certainly the case that both Madhyamaka
and Yogacara are concerned with the highest understanding,
the perfect wisdom that penetrates directly to the way things are,
they also focus on the subtlest forms of greed—the subtlest
tendencies of the mind to grasp, cling, and fix—as the root of all
other forms of greed. In other words, the concern is with the greed
and delusion as the principal causes of suffering, and a complete
letting go as its cessation.

As I have already indicated, it is important to understand in
what sense the Indian authors of the Madhyamaka and Yogacara
theoretical writings are ‘Mahayanists’. Essentially they are
MahAayanists in that they privilege the path of the Bodhisattva
and recognize the authority of the Mahayana siitras. But they
do not reject the earlier tradition. These authors continued to
operate within the existing ordination lineages of the Sangha,
and when trying to justify their understanding of emptiness or
the store consciousness they will as soon appeal to the generally
accepted texts of the Nikayas/Agamas and Abhidharma as to the
Mahayana sitras. Much of Madhyamaka and Yogacara theory
represents a continuation of and development of particular lines
of thought within the broad Abhidharma tradition. Abhidharma
is not rejected or thrown out; rather a particular understanding
of the ontology of a dharma is rejected. But, although dharmas
may ultimately not exist in themselves, the broad Abhidharma
framework remains as the theoretical basis for understanding
the workings of consciousness, for analysing progress along the
path, and for breaking down our basic attachment to self.

The Tathagatagarbha

There is suffering, and the root defilements of greed, aversion, and
delusion cause beings suffering in all its forms. The cessation of

The Mahayana 251

these defilements brings about the cessation of all that suffering.
This is a statement of the first three of the four noble truths—a
statement in primarily negative terms. But we can state the mat-
ter in more positive terms: it is not only the cessation of greed,
aversion, and delusion that bring about the cessation of suffer-
ing but the positive cultivation of wisdom, loving kindness, and
generosity. And this is the fourth noble truth: it is the develop-
ment of such qualities that constitutes the path that leads to the
cessation of suffering.

Another way of talking about the process of the arising of suf-
fering and its cessation is in terms of the formula of dependent
arising; again the usual statement is couched in negative terms:
the progressive cessation of the various links in the chain ends
in the cessation of suffering, but we saw too that this could be
stated positively in terms of the progressive arising of various
qualities beginning with faith and ending in knowledge and free-
dom. For the ordinary unawakened person the root causes of
suffering, the defilements (klesa/kilesa) of greed, aversion, and
delusion, do battle with the root causes of awakening, the good
qualities of wisdom, loving kindness, and generosity: we are
internally in conflict. But this does not mean that we should con-
ceive of ourselves as merely a battleground for a conflict that may
go either way. For, although this may be how things appear in
the short term, it is, according to the teaching of the Buddha
as presented in the Nikayas/Agamas, our better nature that re-
flects our true nature: the mind is naturally radiant but becomes
defiled by adventitious defilements (see p. 175). At heart we are
not Maras but buddhas, and this is true of the being that is Mara
himself. This way of thinking is part of the common heritage of
all Buddhism, but in Mahayana sitras it finds expression and is
developed in the notion of the tathdgata-garbha: the ‘womb’ or
‘embryo’ (the Sanskrit garbha connotes both) of the Tathagata.
Thus in the Mahayana Tathdgatagarbha Siitra, the Buddha
observes:

[W]hen I regard all beings with my buddha eye, I see that hidden within
the kleSas of greed, desire, anger and stupidity there is seated augustly

252 The Mahayana

and unmovingly the tathagata’s wisdom, the tathagata’s vision, and the
tathagata’s body .. . [A]ll beings, though they find themselves with all
sorts of klesas, have a tathagatagarbha that is eternally unsullied, and
that is replete with virtues no different from my own.”

The basic treatise of the tathagatagarbha tradition of thought is
the Ratnagotravibhaga (also known as the Uttaratantra) attributed
to Maitreya/Asanga. The tathagatagarbha is an element of Bud-
dhahood (buddha-dhdatu) at the heart of our being, our intrinsic
‘buddha nature’. Although some Mahayanist writings acknow-
ledged the possibility of beings who are eternally cut off from
the possibility of buddhahood, the prevailing tradition, particu-
larly important in East Asian Buddhism and reaching its most
developed statement in Dogen’s Zen, is that all beings are intrins-
ically Buddhas.

Talk of the tathdgatagarbha as our eternal and true nature
in contrast to illusory and ultimately unreal defilements leads to
a tendency to conceive of it as an ultimate absolutely existing
thing. The Mahayana Mahdaparinirvana Sitra, especially influen-
tial in East Asian Buddhist thought, goes so far as to speak of it
as our true self (atman). Its precise metaphysical and ontolo-
gical status is, however, open to interpretation in the terms of
different Mahayana philosophical schools; for the Madhyamikas
it must be empty of its own existence like everything else; for the
Yogiacarins, following the Lankavatara, it can be identified with
store consciousness, as the receptacle of the seeds of awaken-
ing. Yet the problem of the metaphysics of the tathdgatagarbha
persisted and is perhaps most clearly exemplified in the rang-
stong/gzhan-stong debate in Tibet (see Chapter 10).

South, East, North, and West

Theravada Buddhism in Sri Lanka and South-East Asia:
Southern Buddhism

Buddhism arrived in Sri Lanka in the third century sce; for
the next thousand years or so Sri Lanka was a great centre of
Buddhist learning. The early spread and history of Buddhism
in South-East Asia, on the other hand, is complex. While the
Theravada Buddhism of the Sri Lanka and South-East Asia
should not be viewed as a uniform and monolithic whole, it does
have a certain unity exemplified by the persistence of one main
monastic Vinaya lineage and the authority of the Pali canon and
its commentaries, inherited from the Mahavihara of ancient
Anuradhapura. But this is no simple orthodoxy; a variety of inter-
pretations and practices have probably always existed and per-
sist down to modern times. Too often the models and norms for
religious history employed by moder scholarship revolve around
concepts of schism, heresy, orthodoxy, sect, and denomination,
derived from the history of Christianity. These concepts are not
always appropriate, and obscure the religious history of Buddhism
rather than shed light upon it.

Sri Lanka

The initial formative phase of Theravada Buddhism was com-
pleted by 1000 cE. This is not to say that there are no subsequent
developments or changes, but that Theravada Buddhism largely
defines itself by reference to traditions and teachings that were
established between the fifth and tenth centuries in Sri Lanka;
the twelfth and thirteenth centuries should also be seen as a
significant creative period.

254 Traditions of Buddhism

Following the introduction of Buddhism to Sri Lanka by
Mahinda in the third century BcE (see Chapter 2) there emerged
three great divisions of the Sangha on the island, each centring
on a monastery in the ancient capital of Anuradhapura. The
oldest, the Mahavihara or ‘great monastery’, was established
by Mahinda himself in the third century, the Abhayagiri-vihara
in the first century Bcg, and the Jetavana in the third century
ce. Famed as a centre of Buddhist learning, Anuradhapura at-
tracted visiting monks from the Indian mainland—including one
of Theravada Buddhism’s subsequently most celebrated com-
mentators, Dhammapila (seventh century?)—and also China (Fa-
hsien in the early fifth century).

Beginning in the fifth century, a series of commentators (Bud-
dhaghosa, Buddhadatta, Mahanama, Upasena, Dhammapala I,
Dhammapila IT) drawing on the traditions and textual resources
of the Mahavihara established the classical doctrinal form of the
Theravada, and it is their writings that have come down to us.
The fifth century also saw the basic content and structure of the
Pali canon finally established: (1) a Vinaya comprising two prin-
cipal works; (2) a Sutta Pitaka comprising the four primary
Nikayas and the fifteen works of the Khuddaka Nikaya; (3) an
Abhidhamma Pitaka comprising seven works.!

Since none of the writings of the monks of the Abhayagiri
and Jetavana monasteries survive (with the possible exception
of Upatissa’s Vimuttimagga, which exists only in Chinese trans-
lation), it is not entirely clear in what manner their traditions
differed from those of the Mahavihara.? The tendency to see
the undoubted rivalry between them in terms of a Mahavihara
opposition to their Mahayana sympathies is both simplistic and
problematic. It is important to bear in mind, however, that the
Abhayagiri and Jetavana monasteries continued to flourish and
their monks were as much part of the Sri Lankan Buddhist scene
as those of the Mahavihara.

Invasions of the island from south India resulted in the Sri
Lankan court fleeing further south to Polonnaruva, which was
established as the permanent capital of the island in the eleventh
century after the defeat of the south Indian invaders by Vijaya

Traditions of Buddhism 255

Bahu I. From the second century BcE south Indian kings had
invaded and ruled on several occasions in Anuradhapura with-
out causing any cultural discontinuity, but the wars of the tenth
and eleventh centuries proved particularly destructive of ancient
Sri Lankan culture; the extent to which the lineage of the Bud-
dhist Sangha was disrupted is not entirely clear, but it appears
that the order of nuns died out at this time and that contacts with
Burma played some part in the re-establishment of the traditions
of the three ancient lineages of the Mahavihara, Abhayagiri,
and Jetavana.’ In 1165, however, following a dispute between
these three lineages, King Parakrama Bahu I unified the Sangha
according to the rule of the Mahavihara. But the Buddhism
of Sri Lanka should not be regarded as a simple Mahavihara
‘orthodoxy’ at this period or earlier; indeed, it is doubtful that
Buddhism anywhere has ever operated quite in the manner of
an ‘orthodoxy’. From early times continued contacts with south
India (where it appears Theravada traditions flourished until
at least the fourteenth century) and the arrival of monks from
outside the island meant that various Buddhist influences and
practices, including those of the Mahayana and the Vajrayana,
were present on the island.

Invasion from south India led to the fall of Polonnaruva in
1215. The following centuries witnessed a relative decline in the
institutions of Buddhism in Sri Lanka. From the sixteenth cen-
tury the Portuguese (1505-1658), the Dutch (1658-1796), and
finally the British controlled the coastal kingdom centred on
KOtté and then Colombo, with only the central Kandyan kingdom
retaining its independence. The state of monastic Buddhism
reached a low ebb in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
resulting in the sending of missions to South-East Asia in order
to re-import the higher ordination lineage. This was successfully
accomplished in 1753 during the reign of Kirti Sri Rajasimha
(1747-81). In 1815 the British took control of the Kandyan king-
dom, and their colonial rule of the whole island lasted until
1948. The nineteenth and twentieth centuries saw the emergence
of new ‘modernist’ trends—sometimes referred to as ‘Protest-
ant Buddhism’—in response to Christian missionary activity,

256 Traditions of Buddhism

modernization, and increasing European interest in Buddhist
thought and practice.”*

South-East Asia

Indian cultural influence began to extend into South-East Asia
from the early centuries of the Christian era, and various forms
of Hinduism and traditions of Buddhism had established them-
selves throughout the region by the end of the first millennium.
Tradition has it that Buddhism first entered the area in the third
century BCE with missions sent by Asoka, and this is not impos-
sible. Archaeological evidence confirms the existence of a form
of Theravada Buddhism in the Pyu and Mon kingdoms (in what
is now Burma and Thailand) from the fifth century cg; this form
of Theravada may have been introduced from southern India rather
than Sri Lanka.° Links between the capital of the Burmese king-
dom at Pagan and Sri Lankan Theravada in the eleventh cen-
tury during the reign of King Anawratha (1044-77) indicate that
by this period the Theravada lineages of the Sangha were well
established in the region.

The powerful kingdom of the Khmers (centred on Angkor)
dominated much of the region to the south-east (parts of what
is now Thailand and Cambodia) from the eiglith to the fifteenth
centuries and here different forms of both Hindu and Buddhist
practice flourished. Inscriptional evidence from the eighth cen-
tury suggests the presence of the Theravada Sangha within the
Khmer cultural sphere, and from the twelfth century Mon forms
of Theravada became increasingly influential both at court and
among the population as a whole. The Thai kingdoms began to
establish themselves from the thirteenth century, centring first
on Sukhotai in the north (until the fifteenth century), then on
Ayudhya (until the eighteenth century) and finally on Bangkok
(until the present). State support for the Theravada Sangha and
links with Sri Lanka have been a feature of the kingdom.

While Cambodia and Burma became French and British col-
onies respectively, Thailand retained its independence throughout
the colonial period. But modernizing influences were not absent
from the country, and in the nineteenth century Rama IV (1851-
68) instigated the establishment of the reformed Dhammayuttika

Traditions of Buddhism 257

lineage of the Sangha. The influence of this reform in Thai-
land and beyond has resulted in the gradual decline of many of
the older esoteric traditions and practices of South-East Asian
Theravada associated with the Mahanikaya lineage and docu-
mented in the works of Francois Bizot.® These traditions flour-
ished until most recently in Cambodia, but the fanatical activities
of Pol Pot’s Khmer Rouge between 1975 and 1978, when per-
haps a million Cambodians died, involved the murder of many
monks and the forced disrobing of the rest. This means that little
is left on the ground.

China, Korea, and Japan: East Asian Buddhism

The Buddhism of China, Korea, and Japan constitutes a unity that
can be referred to as East Asian or Eastern Buddhism because
it shares a common basis in the scriptural resource of the Chi-
nese Tripitaka and because Korean and Japanese forms and
schools derive directly from Chinese forms and schools, although
they subsequently developed distinctive local traditions. Bud-
dhism began entering China during the Han dynasty (206 BCE-
220 CE), probably in the first century BCE or CE, principally via the
ancient silk routes through central Asia. From China Buddhism
entered the Korean peninsula (fourth century) and thence Japan
(sixth century).

Significant in the establishment of Buddhism as a part of Chi-
nese life in the following centuries was the appeal of Buddhist
ideas and meditation practices to the followers of neo-Taoism
(Hsiian Hsiieh), although the growing popular acceptance of this
‘foreign’ doctrine also prompted periodic opposition from both
Confucian and Taoist circles.” The T’ang dynasty (618-907) wit-
nessed the greatest flourishing of Buddhism in China. Buddhism
continued to flourish until the end of the thirteenth century
under the Sung, but the period from the fifteenth century is gen-
erally regarded as one of relative decline. Yet in the first half of
the twentieth century Buddhism was still the most significant reli-
gious force in China.’ The Communist take-over of 1949 and espe-
cially the ‘Cultural Revolution’ of 1966-72 brought with them a

258 Traditions of Buddhism

widespread government suppression of Buddhism, which, in the
more recent period, has given way to a more tolerant attitude.’
The traditions of Chinese Buddhism also continue in Taiwan and
Hong Kong.

The development of the Chinese canon

When Buddhism began entering China the Mahayana was still
in its early stages of development; the writings of Nagarjuna,
Asanga, and Vasubandhu were still to come. The most import-
ant early centre of Buddhism in China seems to have been at
Lo-yang and it is here, from the middle of the second century,
that foreign monks such as An Shih-kao and Lokaksema (Chih
Lou-chia-ch’an) began the work of translating Indian Buddhist
texts into Chinese; these first translations included texts on med-
itation (such as the non-Mahayana Andpana-smrti Siitra or ‘Dis-
course on Mindfulness of Breathing’ and the proto-Mahayana
Pratyutpanna-buddha-sammukhévasthita-samadhi Sitra or ‘Dis-
course on the Samadhi of Direct Encounter with the Buddhas
of the Present’) and portions of the Perfection of Wisdom in 8,000
Lines (Asta-sahasrika Prajnaparamita).’°

The manner of these early translations is characteristic of
the whole process of translation of Indian Buddhist texts into
Chinese. The Indian canonical collections were never translated
into Chinese en bloc. The Chinese Tripitaka (San-tsang) or ‘Great
Treasury of Siitras’ (Ta-tsang-ching) evolved over a period of
over a thousand years."! Rather than a strictly defined canon, the
Chinese Tripitaka represents a library containing all the Chinese
translations of Buddhist siitras and Sastras made over the cen-
turies, as well as a variety of indigenous Chinese treatises rel-
ating to Buddhism. The oldest. surviving catalogue of Chinese
Buddhist texts dates from the sixth century and details over 2,000
works; the first printed edition, produced from 130,000 wooden
blocks and completed in 983, contained 1,076 works. Subsequent
catalogues and editions, produced in Korea and Japan as well as
China, show some divergence both in the arrangement of the canon
and in its contents. The modern standard is the Taisho edition,
produced in Japan between 1924 and 1932. Its fifty-five volumes,

Traditions of Buddhism 259

each some 1,000 pages in length, contain 2,184 works: volumes
I to 32 consist of translations of ancient Indian works (1,692 texts);
volumes 33 to 54 of works by Chinese monks (452 texts); volume
55 of ancient catalogues (40 texts). The whole is supplemented
by a further 45 volumes containing works of Japanese origin, and
other ancillary material.”

The Taish6 edition groups texts on more or less historical prin-
ciples. A more traditional arrangement is reflected by an im-
portant catalogue produced at the end of the nineteenth century
by the Japanese scholar Bunyiu Nanjio.’? This is basically a
catalogue of an edition of the Chinese Tripitaka produced in the
early seventeenth century at the end of the Ming dynasty which
contains a total of 1,662 works and provides the easiest way
for gaining an impression of the range and scope of the Chinese
canon. The three traditional divisions of Sitra (ching), Vinaya
(lii), and Treatise (Jun) are each subdivided according to the cat-
egories of ‘Mahayana’ and ‘Hinayana’, and finally supplemented
by a fourth division. The Sitra collection is the largest (1,081
texts); although largely taken up by the vast corpus of Mahayana
sitras, it also contains the Chinese Agamas corresponding to the
Pali Nikayas. The Vinaya section (85 texts) contains translations
of the Vinayas of various Indian schools and related works. The
third division (154 texts) is devoted to treatises; this section
includes the canonical Abhidharma texts of the Sarvastivadins,
as well as other Abhidharma, Madhyamaka, and Yogacara treat-
ises and commentaries. These three divisions of translations of
Indian Buddhist materials are supplemented by a miscellaneous
collection of writings (342 texts) by Indian and Chinese Buddhist
masters.

The schools of East Asian Buddhism

The schools (tsung) of Chinese Buddhism divide into two main
categories: those which have a more or less direct Indian counter-
part and those which are native to China. The principal schools
of the former category are the Vinaya, the KoSa, the Madhyamaka,
the Yogacara, and the Mantrayana; of the latter category, Ch’an,
Pure Land, T’ien-t’ai, and Hua-yen. In principle these are also

260 Traditions of Buddhism

the schools of Korean and Japanese Buddhism. In practice cer-
tain of the schools developed more significant local traditions
than others. In Korea special mention should be made of the
S6n (Ch’an) teaching of Chinul (1158-1210).'* In Japan Tendai
(T’ien-t’ai), Zen (Ch’an), Shingon (Mantray4na), Pure Land, along
with the distinctively Japanese tradition of Nichiren have been
of special importance.

Chinese Buddhist monks eventually came to be ordained
according to the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, and Chinese Buddhist
schools do not constitute separate ordination lineages, but focus
on a lineage of teaching and interpretation of Buddhist thought
and practice. Movement between the schools seems to have been
normal. But early attempts to establish the norms of Buddhist
monastic practice in China were felt to be hampered by a lack
of knowledge of the Vinaya. It was this that prompted Fa-hsien,
at the age of almost 60, to set out in 399 on a journey to India
and Sri Lanka that was to last fourteen years. Subsequently the
Vinaya School (Lii-tsung) of Chinese Buddhism was founded in
the early seventh century by Tao-hsiian (596-667) as a focus for
Chinese Vinaya studies.

The great translator Kumarajiva (344-413), a central Asian
monk who had studied in Kashmir, arrived in China in 383; his
translation of two works by Nagarjuna and a third by Aryadeva
marks the beginning of the Chinese Madhyamaka or ‘Three
Treatise School’ (San-lun-tsung).'> The development in China
of the other great Indian Mahayana system, the Yogacara, is
associated with the work of the Indian monk Paramartha, who
arrived in Canton in 546, and Hsiian-tsang, who, as mentioned
above, visited India in the seventh century and returned to China
to found the ‘Characteristics of Dharmas’ (Fa-hsiang) school.
Ancillary to this school was the Chu-she or (Abhidharma-)Koéa
school.

The form of Mahayana Buddhist practice known as ‘the
vehicle of protective spells’ (mantra-ydana) or tantra is most wide-
spread within Tibetan Buddhism (see below), but a tradition of
esoteric practice was introduced into China early in the eighth
century by the Indians Subhakarasimha (637-735) and Vajrabodhi

Traditions of Buddhism 261

(671-741) and the Sri Lankan Amoghavajra (705-74). The
principal text was the Mahavairocana and Vajrasekhara Siitras,
associated with the practice of the garbha-kosa-dhatu and vajra-
dhatu mandalas respectively. A mandala is a diagram (usually
based on a square and/or circle orientated to the four direc-
tions) of the cosmos in the form of a vision of a set of buddhas
and bodhisattvas which then acts as a basis for visualization and
meditation for those who have been initiated into its practice by
an accomplished master. Chinese Mantrayana or “True Word’
(Chen Yen) flourished only briefly, although it enjoyed a limited
revival in the twentieth century, partly because of Tibetan and
Japanese influence. The school was, however, early on introduced
to Japan by one of the great geniuses of Japanese culture, Kikai
or K6b6 Daishi (774-835), who in 804 travelled to China in search
of instruction. Shingon remains a significant school of Japanese
Buddhism today.'°

Ch’an Buddhism

The term ch’an (Japanese zen) derives from the Sanskrit dhyana,
which, as we have seen, is used in Indian Buddhist theory to
designate the attainment of a deep state of peace by the means
of calm meditation. The term comes to refer to one of the import-
ant schools of East Asian Buddhism. Ch’an tradition looks to
the legendary figure of the Indian monk Bodhidharma, who is
said to have come east in the fifth or sixth century cE, as its first
‘patriarch’, but it is likely that the roots of Ch’an lie further back
in Chinese Buddhist history with the interest shown in medi-
tation practice by such figures as Tao-an (312-85), Hui-yiian
(334-416), and Tao-sheng (360-434).

Ch’an tradition has it that, beginning with Bodhidharma, the
lineage of teaching and the title of ‘patriarch’ passed from mas-
ter to pupil. The transmission to the sixth patriarch, however,
became the object of dispute. Originally it was assumed to have
passed to Shen-hsiu (600-706), but in 734 this succession was
challenged by a southern monk named Shen-hui (670-762), who
claimed that in fact Hui-neng (638-713) had been the true sixth

262 Traditions of Buddhism

patriarch. Shen-hui and his ‘southern’ school of Ch’an were the
effective winners of the dispute, with Hui-neng now looked
upon as a second founder of Ch’an.

Shen-hui was an advocate of the doctrine of ‘sudden awaken-
ing’, and one of the things that he charged Shen-hsiu with was
teaching a doctrine of ‘gradual awakening’. This dispute over
whether awakening should be regarded as a gradual process or
a sudden event was not confined to Ch’an circles, but was a ques-
tion that preoccupied Chinese Buddhism from an early date.”
To some extent the problem reflects the old Abhidharma dis-
cussion over the question of whether, at the time of awakening,
the four noble truths are seen gradually (as the Sarvastivadins
argued) or in a single instant (as the Theravadins, amongst others,
argued): ultimate truth is not something one can see part of;
one either sees it complete, or not at all. Yet the account of the
bodhisattva path the Chinese inherited from India details vari-
ous stages with definite attainments and points of no return. After
Shen-hui, Ch’an became very much associated with a sudden awak-
ening view.

Bodhidharma is said to have emphasized the teachings of the
Lankdvatara Siitra, and the theoretical basis of Ch’an centres on
the notions of the tathagatagarbha and ‘emptiness’ as pointing
beyond all conceptual forms of thought. Our innermost nature
is simply the Buddha-nature (fo-hsing) which is to be realized in
a direct and sudden experience of inner awakening (wu/satori).
Ch’an tradition has a marked tendency to be critical of con-
ventional theory and discursive philosophy, which it sees as
cluttering the mind and creating obstacles to direct experience.
Emphasis is put on just sitting in meditation (tso ch’an/zazen),
the carrying out of ordinary routine tasks and the all-important
instruction of the Ch’an master. Ch’an’s own considerable liter-
ary and intellectual tradition centres on the stories of the sayings
and deeds of these Ch’an masters, who may be portrayed as behav-
ing in unexpected and spontaneous ways and responding to ques-
tions with apparent non-sequiturs and riddles (kung-an/kéan) in
order to jolt their pupils from their habitual patterns of thought
and prompt in them an awakening experience.

Traditions of Buddhism 263

Question: ‘If a man has his head shaved, wears a monk’s robe, and takes
the shelter Buddha gives, why then should he not be recognized as one
who is aware of Buddha?’ Master: ‘It is not as good to have something
as to have nothing.’'*

Although as many as five different Ch’an schools had emerged
by the ninth century, only two of these remained important after
the government suppression of Buddhist monasticism in 842-5:
the Lin Chi (Japanese Rinzai) and Ts’ao Tung (Japanese Sotd).
The former placed particular emphasis on the paradoxical riddle
of the kung-an, and the master’s bizarre behaviour; the latter placed
more emphasis on formal sitting meditation; in Japan it is asso-
ciated with the important figure of Dogen (1200-53).

Pure Land Buddhism

As we saw in the opening chapter, the Buddha has always been
seen as possessor of incomparable powers and as the incompar-
able teacher of the Dharma. For earliest Buddhism the actual
person of the Buddha is no longer directly accessible after his final
parinirvana, and devotion to the Buddha centred on the worship
of his relics, the recollection of his qualities (buddhanusmrti/
buddhanussati), and perhaps also visualization. Such practices
clearly were felt to bring one in some sense closer to the pres-
ence of the Buddha. Early Buddhism also knew of Maitreya/
Metteyya, the next buddha, who at present waits in the Tusita
heaven; the aspiration to be reborn at the time when Maitreya
will teach the Dharma may have become part of Buddhist prac-
tice early on. With the rise of the Mahayana came the idea that
buddhas are at present teaching in other parts of the universe in
their own special ‘buddha fields’ or ‘pure lands’ where the con-
ditions for the practice of the Dharma are extremely favourable.
With this came the aspiration to be reborn in these pure lands.
The inspiration for Chinese and Japanese ‘Pure Land’ Buddhism
is provided by three siitras: the larger and the smaller Sukhavati-
vytha (‘Vision of the Realm of Happiness’) and the Amitayurd-
hyana (‘Meditation on the Buddha of Boundless Life’). The
two former are of Indian origin, while the last may have been

264 Traditions of Buddhism

composed in central Asia or China. These sitras tell of the pure
land of the Buddha Amitabha (Boundless Light) or Amitayus,
known in Japanese as Amida. The particular focus of East
Asian Pure Land Buddhism became the vow of Amitabha in the
Sukhavati-vyitha to bring to his pure land after death any one
who sincerely calls on his name. The characteristic practice of
Pure Land Buddhism, advocated in the writings of such masters
as T’an-luan (476-542), Tao-cho (562-645), and Shan-tao (613-
81), is known as nien-fo (Japanese nembutsu), calling on or utter-
ing the name of the Buddha. Also associated with the school is
a preoccupation with the old Indian idea that the practice of
the Buddha’s teaching must pass through successive periods of
decline and eventually disappear.'® This led to an emphasis on
the futility of expecting to be able, by one’s own efforts, to de-
velop the good conduct and meditation necessary for awakening
in the final days of the Dharma (mo fa/mapp6); better to aspire
to rebirth in Amitabha’s pure land. The eventual development
in Japan was a doctrine of grace associated above all with the
figure of Shinran (1173-1262), founder of the ‘True Pure Land
School’ (Jodo Shinshii): it is not ‘one’s own power’ (jiriki) but
the ‘power of the other’ (tariki)—the grace of Amitabha—that
is effective in bringing one to his pure land.”*

Tien-t’ai and Hua-yen
By the middle of the sixth century Indian Buddhist texts of vari-
ous sorts and from numerous schools all purporting to be the
word of the Buddha had been translated into Chinese. Both
Tien-t’ai and Hua-yen start from the premiss that the diverse
and seemingly contradictory teachings represented by these
texts must be ordered and arranged into a coherent whole. Both
schools thus propose a system of division and classification of the
Buddha’s teachings (p’an-chiao). The theoretical basis for this
is the concept of the Buddha’s ‘skill in means’ (updya-kauSalya):
the notion that the Buddha adapted his teachings according to
the ability of his hearers to understand.

For Chih-i (538-97), the founder of T’ien-t’ai, the Buddha’s
teaching should be arranged according to the ‘five periods and
eight teachings’. The final teaching of the Buddha is found in the

Traditions of Buddhism 265

Lotus Sitra. Chih-i expressed his understanding of Buddhist
metaphysics and dependent arising in the form of a doctrine known
as ‘the threefold truth’: phenomena are at once empty of exist-
ence, temporarily existing, and poised in the middle between
existence and non-existence. Associated with the elaboration
of this doctrine, which is seen as relating all things to each other
and to the whole, is a theory of the ‘interpenetration’ of all
phenomena: every individual thing in the universe contains and
at the same time is contained in everything else, or, as Chih-i
himself would put it, one thought is the 3,000 worlds.”! While some
of the writings of Chih-i represent sophisticated (and mind-
boggling) intellectual meditations on the interdependence of all
things, others also show a concern for the down-to-earth prob-
lems and practicalities of just sitting in meditation.”

The Hua-yen school was founded by Tu-shun (557-640) and
its thought was developed especially in the writings of Fa-tsang
(643-712). For Hua-yen the vast Avatamsaka or ‘Flower Garland’
Sitra collection represents the highest teaching. As with Tien-t’ai,
great emphasis is put on an elaborate theory of the interpenetra-
tion of all phenomena.”

Nichiren

An important and distinctive form of Buddhism is associated with
the name of the Japanese prophet Nichiren (1222-82). Nichiren’s
Buddhism springs from the view that Japanese Buddhism and
Japanese society were, in the mid-thirteenth century, passing
through a state of crisis. Although he criticized other forms of
Buddhist practice as ineffective, his understanding of the Lotus
Sitra as the highest teaching of the Buddha derives from Tendai
(T’ien-t’ai); his insistence on a single chant as the only effect-
ive form of practice in the days of mappd owes something to
Japanese Pure Land traditions. Nichiren’s Buddhism thus cen-
tres on the repeated chanting of the daimoku, homage to the sacred
title of the Lotus Siitra (na-mu my6-hd-ren-ge-kyd), backed up
by a complex and sophisticated theory of the manner in which
the syllables of the chant actualize Sakyamuni Buddha, trans-
forming the individual and society. By all accounts Nichiren was
an uncompromising and provocative teacher. In the centuries after

266 Traditions of Buddhism

his death Nichiren’s message attracted a considerable following
in Japan, and today the numerous sub-sects of Nichiren Buddhism
together continue to constitute one of the significant schools of
Buddhism in Japan. Among the important Nichiren sub-sects
is the Nichiren Shdshi' or S6ka Gakkai, which has been active
in Japanese politics since the 1960s, and must also be reckoned
a significant presence in the context of Buddhism in Europe and
America.”

Tibet and Mongolia: Northern Buddhism

Tibetan tradition makes reference to a first and second diffusion
of Buddhism in Tibet. Tradition links the introduction of Bud-
dhism to Tibet with the two wives of King Srong-bsan-sgam-po
(d. 649), one of whom came from Nepal and the other from China,
who thus introduced both Indian and Chinese forms of Bud-
dhism. But the Buddhist presence in Tibet remained superficial
for another century. It was not until the latter half of the eighth
century, during the reign of King Khri Srong-lde-brtsan (756-—
972), that the Indian monk Santaraksita was invited to estab-
lish the first monastery, bSam-yas. In order to accomplish his
purpose, Santaraksita is said to have had to call on an Indian
yogin, Padmasambhava, to assist in the task of subduing the local
demons hostile to Buddhism. Tradition records a dispute at bSam-
yas or Lhasa in 792-4 between an Indian faction, headed by
Santaraksita’s disciple Kamalasila, and a Chinese faction, headed
by the teacher (hva-shang) Mahayana.” The dispute is charac-
terized as centring on the question of gradual (the Indians) or
sudden (the Chinese) awakening; the Indian opinion supporting
gradual awakening is said to have prevailed, but all this is prob-
ably a simplification of a complex history, and we can assume some
influence of Chinese forms of Buddhism on Tibetan Buddhism.

A ‘second diffusion’ of Buddhism in Tibet occurred after its
suppression during the reign of gLang-dar-ma (838-42), and is
associated especially with the activity of the Indian monk and
yogin Atiga (982-1054), which led to the founding of the mon-
astery of Rva-spreng by his disciple ‘Brom-ston in 1057, and the

Traditions of Buddhism 267

establishment of the bKa’ gdams-pa school, which set the course
for the future development of Buddhist monasticism in Tibet.
Atisa also wrote for his Tibetan pupils a short but extremely
influential and much commented upon summary of Buddhist prac-
tice, the Bodhi-patha-pradipa (‘Lamp on the Path to Awakening’).

The Kanjur and Tenjur

As with the Chinese translation of Buddhist texts, Indian canon-
ical collections of Buddhist texts were not translated en bloc,
rather individual texts were translated one by one over several
centuries.”* Tibetan Buddhist tradition divides its scriptures into
two canonical collections: the Kanjur (bKa’ ’gyur), or ‘translated
word of the Buddha’, and the Tenjur (bsTan ’gyur), or ‘trans-
lated treatises’.

The Kanjur came into existence at the beginning of the four-
teenth century in response to a need to collect and arrange the
enormous numbers of these texts that had been translated into
Tibetan between the seventh and thirteenth centuries. The earli-
est woodblock printed edition was in fact produced in 1410 in
Peking and not in Tibet. Like the Chinese Tripitaka, the Kanjur
exists in several editions and recensions which diverge slightly
in their arrangement and the number of texts they include, but
it usually comprises 700-800 texts in just over 100 volumes. One
of the most widely used and favoured editions today is a repro-
duction of the Derge (sDe dge) block-print edition of 1733.

The arrangement of the Kanjur does not follow the three-
fold division of the earlier Indian canonical collections; the fol-
lowing division into seven categories is typical: (1) Vinaya or
monastic discipline (’Dul-ba), (2) Perfection of Wisdom (Sher
phyin), which is often further divided, (3) the Buddhavatamsaka
(Phal-chen), (4) Ratnakiita (dKon-brtsegs) (5) Siitra (mDo), (6)
the Mahayana Maha-Parinirvana (Myang ’das), and (7) tantra
(rGyud). The huge Sitra collection occupies a third of the Kanjur
and is almost entirely devoted to Mahayana sitras, although some
material from the earlier Nikayas/Agamas is included. Next in
size is the tantra collection which occupies about one-fifth of the
Kanjur. At one-eighth of the whole, the Vinaya comes third in size.

268 Traditions of Buddhism

The canonical Abhidharma texts, which constituted the third
division of the older Indian canons, are not included in the
Tibetan Kanjur. Tibetan study of the Abhidharma is based on
Sarvastivadin and Yogacarin treatises included in the other great
canonical collection of Tibetan Buddhism, namely the Tenjur,
which contains over 3,500 texts (mostly translations of Indian
commentaries and treatises) in over 200 volumes.

Tantric Buddhism

The forms of Buddhist practice and teaching that were introduced
to Tibet from the seventh to the twelfth centuries were funda-
mentally those current across northern and eastern India at the
time. Tibetan Buddhist teaching and practice divides into two
main types: (1) the conventional Mahayana ‘gradual path’ (lam
rim) of the perfections and bhimis as taught in the Mahayana
stitras and expounded by subsequent tradition; (2) the esoteric
path of the tantras (Tibetan rgyud).

Tantra represents the final development of Indian Buddhism.
It should not be regarded as a further development in Bud-
dhist thought, but is rather a particular approach to the practice
of the Buddhist path occurring within the general Mahayana
philosophical framework, as set out by the Madhyamaka and
Yogacara, and giving special emphasis to the idea of the equi-
valence of nirvana and samsara. Tantra is also referred to as ‘the
vehicle of protective spells’ (mantra-yana/sNgagstheg-pa) or ‘the
vehicle of the diamond thunderbolt’ (vajra-yana/rDo-rjetheg-
pa). Tibetan tradition links its practice in India and transmission
to Tibet to a group of eighty-four siddhas (grub-thob) or ‘accom-
plished ones’, legendary for their extraordinary magical powers
and their eccentric and unpredictable behaviour.’

Tantras are texts setting out certain esoteric meditation prac-
tices which present themselves as a secret teaching deriving
directly from the Buddha himself. Modern scholarship, however,
dates the production of these texts to a period over 1,000 years
after the Buddha, and regards them as evolving as part of a wider
Indian tantric movement. The Vajrayana is seen as a powerful
and extremely effective method of practice leading directly to

Traditions of Buddhism 269

the complete awakening of a buddha, but it requires absolute
commitment and dedication. Tibetan Buddhist schools tend to
follow their own particular lineages and versions of the gradual
path and tantric teachings; in both instances, however, the teach-
ings of different schools are broadly similar in outlook.
Tantras are generally classified according to a hierarchical
scheme of four classes: action (Kriya), performance (caryda), yoga,
and supreme yoga (anuttara-yoga).”* Effective practice (sadhana)
of any tantra depends on receiving the appropriate ‘consecration’
(abhiseka/dBang) and instruction directly from a teacher (guru/
bLama) who is a master of the tantra in question. The practice
of the lowest tantras centres on external rituals and devotions
directed towards the gods, goddesses, and buddhas of the tantra.
At all stages of tantric practice a complex and elaborate sym-
bolism links visualizations, liturgy, and ritual in order to fully
engage and focus the activity of body, speech, and mind. The carya
and yoga tantras develop complex visualizations of and medi-
tations on ‘chosen deities’ (ista-devata/yi-dam) and buddhas of
sublime realms; by a process of gradual identification, the prac-
titioner actualizes their wisdom, compassion and other spiritual
qualities. The higher tantras increasingly centre on an elaborate
theory of yoga involving a complex physiology of the ‘chan-
nels’, ‘centres’, ‘winds’, and ‘drops’ of the subtle body which the
practitioner learns to control and manipulate in order to trans-
form his or her own body into the body of a buddha. One aspect
of the theory of the subtle body involves an esoteric relation-
ship between the experiences of bliss in sexual union and the
primordial bliss of the mind. The initial consecration and prac-
tice associated with the supreme yoga tantras may thus involve
sexual union with a consort, the underlying symbolism here
being the union of wisdom (female) and compassion (male). Such
a practice may also be performed as a visualization; in the case
of ordained monks, whose vows prohibit any sexual activity, it
can only be performed as such. The purpose here, as with all
Buddhist practice, is not, of course, the feeding of desire but its
final transformation and eradication: desire is employed at an
advanced stage of practice in order finally to reveal its nature.

The schools of Tibetan Buddhism

The schools of Tibetan Buddhism focus on particular lineages
of teachings passed from teacher to disciple, and not on differ-
ent monastic ordination lineages. Four main schools of Tibetan
Buddhism survive today, with, as one might expect, a number
of sub-schools. The rNying-ma-pas trace their roots back to the
first diffusion of Buddhism in Tibet and the legendary figure
of Padmasambhava, many of whose teachings were considered
to have been concealed as ‘hidden treasures’ (gTer-ma) to be
subsequently found and taught by a series of ‘treasure finders’
(gTer-stons). The rNying-ma-pas preserve a distinctive classi-
fication of Buddhist teachings into nine ‘vehicles’. The first three
are the conventional vehicles of the disciple, solitary buddha,
and bodhisattva; the middle three concern lower tantric practice,
while the final three concern highest tantric practice, called by
the rNying-ma-pas rDzogs-chen or ‘great fulfilment’, and under-
stood as the realization of the primordial and spontaneous purity
of mind. Characteristic of the rNying-ma school, although not
confined to it, is a strong tradition of lay trantric teachers known
as sNgags-pa-s.

The bKa’-brgyud-pas look back to the Indian yogin Naropa
(956-1040), and trace the lineage of their teachings through
Mar-pa (1012-96), Mi-la Ras-pa (1040-1123), and sGam-po-pa
(1079-1153). Their gradual path teachings derive from Ati§a’s
bKa’-gdams-pa tradition and were set out classically by sGam-
po-pa in his Jewel Ornament of Liberation; their tantric teachings
centre on the ‘Great Seal’ (mahdmudra/phyag-chen). The bKa’-
brgyud spawned various sub-schools. The Kar-ma bKa’-brgyud
sub-school is headed by a teacher given the title Karma-pa; the
first of these, Dus-gsum-mkhyen-pa (1110-93), is said to have
prophesied the manner and circumstances of his future birth,
so that his spruls-skus or ‘creation body’ (nirmana-kaya) could
be identified and installed as the next Karma-pa.” This custom
whereby a teacher gives instructions for recognizing his reincarn-
ated successor is now most famously associated with the office
of the Dalai Lama of the dGe-lugs school.

Traditions of Buddhism 271

Sa-skya-pa origins and history are intimately connected with
the ’Khon family. "Khon dKon-mchog rGyal-po founded the
Sa-skya monastery in south-west Tibet in 1073. Characteristic
of the Sa-skya school is a monastic tradition in association
with a specifically "Khon family lineage of married yogins pass-
ing the teaching from father to son or from uncle to nephew. From
the beginning of the twelfth until the middle of the fourteenth
century the Sa-skya-pas enjoyed considerable political influence
in Tibet. Five ‘great masters’ are recognized, the most important
of which is usually regarded as Sa-skya Pandita (1182-1251).
The Sa-skya-pa gradual-path ‘siitra’ teachings, known as the
‘Leaving behind the Four Desires’ (zhen-pa bzhi bral), revolve
around the exegesis of four lines said to have been uttered by
the Bodhisattva of Wisdom, Maijijusri, to the 11-year-old Kun-
dga’ snying-po (1092-1158), the second of the five masters:

If you desire this life, you are not a religious person.

If you desire the round of existence, you have not turned around with
conviction.

If you desire benefit for yourself, you do not have the thought of
awakening.

If grasping ensues, you do not have the view.

The other main teaching of the school is a combined sitra and
tantra teaching called ‘Path and Fruit’ (Jam-’bras), which is asso-
ciated with the Hevajra tantra. This teaching is traced to the Indian
tantric yogin Virtipa (c. ninth century), one of the eighty-four
siddhas.

In more recent Tibetan history it is the powerful dGe-lugs-
pa school that has been politically dominant. The dGe-lugs-pa
school sees itself as the principal inheritor of the bKa’ gdams-pa
tradition. Founded in the fourteenth century by the scholar-monk
Tsong-kha-pa (1357-1419), the school reaffirmed monasticism
and is famed for its scholarship, particularly its exegesis of
Madhyamaka thought. Its sitra and tantra teachings are based
on Tsong-kha-pa’s two principal works: The Great Gradual Path
(Lam-rim chen-mo), a commentary on Atisa’s Lamp, and The

272 Traditions of Buddhism

Great Path of Mantra (sngags-rim chen-mo), which centres on
the Kalacakra and Guhya-samaja tantras.

The head of the dGe-lugs was officially the abbot of Ganden
(dGa’-ldan), the original dGe-lugs monastery founded by Tsong-
kha-pa, but this position has been gradually overshadowed by
the Dalai Lamas, chief incumbents of Drepung (’Bras-spungs)
monastery. The title goes back to the sixteenth century and to
dGe-lugs relations with the Mongols, whose ruler, Altan Khan,
declared bSod-nams-rgya-mtsho, the third in a line of rein-
carnating dGe-lugs lamas, ‘an ocean (Mongolian dalai) [of wis-
dom]’; bSod-nams-rgya-mtsho was thus subsequently regarded
as the third Dalai Lama. From the time of the fifth Dalai Lama,
bLo-bzang-rgya-mtsho (1612-82), the Dalai Lama has acted as
Tibetan head of state. The Dalai Lama is thus neither the for-
mal head of Tibetan Buddhism—a kind of Tibetan Buddhist
equivalent to the Pope—nor strictly the head of the dGe-lugs-
pa school. As the head of the Tibetan government in exile and
as a teacher of great spiritual authority in his own right, the pre-
sent Dalai Lama remains a focus for the Tibetan community’s
devotion and respect. Chinese troops invaded Tibet in 1950; by
1959 the Dalai Lama had little option but to flee to India. In Tibet
first the People’s Liberation Army and thén the Red Guard
continued the systematic destruction of Tibetan Buddhist cul-
ture involving the death of perhaps a million Tibetans and the
destruction of over 6,000 monasteries.”

Buddhist thought in Tibet

Tibetan Buddhism has not developed distinctively Tibetan tra-
ditions of Buddhist philosophy quite in the manner of Chinese
T’ien-t’ai and Hua-yen. Generally the Madhyamaka doctrine
of emptiness is regarded as the highest and final philosophical
statement of Buddhist teaching, though ideas and teachings asso-
ciated with the Yogacara remain influential, and the precise
interpretation of Madhyamaka is nuanced in various ways. The
most significant philosophical debate centred on the question
of whether behind appearances there is some reality that can be
characterized as ultimately existing or not, a true ‘Absolute’. The

Traditions of Buddhism 273

view that there is such an ultimately existing reality is known as
‘empty of what is other’ (gzhan stong); that is to say, true real-
ity is empty in so far as it is empty of everything other than itself.
The view was expounded by Dol-po-pa Shes-rab rGyal-mtshan
(1292-1361) and has found considerable support within Tibetan
Buddhism. The more mainstream Madhyamaka view is known
as ‘empty of itself’ (rang stong), emphasizing that ultimate truth
about the nature of reality is that it is empty even of its own
existence. This is a discussion that once more reflects the prob-
lems Buddhist thought has had in arriving at a proper statement
of the middle between the two extremes of eternalism and
annihilationism.*!

A final note: Buddhism in the West

The earliest European contact with Buddhism is likely to have
been around the beginning of the third century BcE, when
Megasthenes, ambassador of Seleucus Nicator, Alexander the
Great’s successor in his eastern empire, was at the Mauryan court
of Candragupta in Pataliputra (modern Patna). Megasthenes’
Greek account of Indian life does not survive in full, but it was
the chief source of information about India in ancient Europe
and is known from its frequent quotation by ancient authorities.
Although there is clear evidence of trade between Alexandria
and Rome, on the one hand, and south India and Sri Lanka, on
the other, the extent of cultural exchange between the European
classical world and India is unclear. For the fifteen hundred years
from the time of Megasthenes down to the thirteenth century
we have no real record of direct contact between Europeans and
Asian Buddhists; knowledge of Indian and Chinese culture was
to remain almost non-existent in Europe. But from the thirteenth
century, with the gradually increasing trade and missionary act-
ivity which culminated in full-blown European colonialism in
Asia, Europeans began travelling to Mongolia, China, India, and
Tibet and writing accounts of their travels which included some
reference to and information on Buddhism. One of the earliest
and perhaps most celebrated accounts is that of Marco Polo,

274 Traditions of Buddhism

who was supposedly in China from 1275 to 1291. Yet these early
European travellers’ interest in and knowledge of Buddhism
remained limited. Possibly the earliest sustained attempt to
understand Buddhist thought by a European is represented by
the Jesuit father Ippolito Desideri, who spent five years in the
Tibetan capital, Lhasa, at the beginning of the eighteenth cen-
tury, endeavouring to come to grips with Tsong kha pa’s pre-
sentation of Madhyamaka Buddhist thought.*”

A European tradition of oriental and Buddhist scholarship
—associated with such names as William Jones (1746-94), Alex-
ander Csoma de KG6rés (1798-1842), Eugéne Burnouf (1801-52),
Friedrich Max Miiller (1823-1900), T. W. Rhys Davids (1843-
1922), Hermann Oldenberg (1854-1920), Theodor Stcherbatsky
(1866-1942), Louis de La Vallée Poussin (1869-1938), Giuseppe
Tucci (1894-1984), and Etienne Lamotte (1903-83)—began to make
available in Europe translations of Indian, Chinese, and Tibetan
texts.*° These fed the imaginations of the likes of Schopenhauer
(1788-1860), Emerson (1803-82), Thoreau (1817-1862), W. B.
Yeats (1865-1939), and T. S. Eliot (1888-1965).

Following this firing of the European imagination, the final years
of the nineteenth century saw Europeans beginning to set off for
Asia not just as civil servants or scholars, but in search of ‘the
wisdom of the east’: in 1890 Madame Blavatsky and Colonel Olcott,
who had founded the Theosophical Society in 1875 in New York,
publicly took the refuges and precepts in Sri Lanka; in 1898 Allan
Bennett, a former member of the esoteric Order of the Golden
Dawn, left Britain, travelling to Sri Lanka and then on to Burma,
where in 1901 he was ordained as the Buddhist monk Ananda
Metteyya; Anthon Gueth (1878-1956) made a similar trip from
Germany to ordain as Nyanatiloka in 1904, returning to Sri
Lanka to found the Dodanduwa ‘Island Hermitage’ in 1911; in
1912 the remarkable Frenchwoman Madame Alexandra David-
Neel (1868-1969), had an audience with the thirteenth Dalai Lama
in Kalimpong and subsequently spent many years in Sikkim and
Tibet involved in Buddhist practice.

Back in Europe and America various Buddhist groups were
established. East Asian immigration to the USA at the end of

Traditions of Buddhism 275

the nineteenth century was particularly significant in the early
establishment of Zen traditions there. But it is the period since
the Second World War that has witnessed the greatest growth
in Western interest in Buddhism. A particular feature of this inter-
est has been the increased contact with the living traditions of
Asian Buddhist practice. This contact has resulted both from the
movements of various Asian groups to all parts of the world in
the period after the war and the growing numbers of Westerners
travelling east since the late 1960s. Of particular significance in
this context has been the presence since 1959 of the Tibetan refugee
community in Dharmsala in north India; this has served as both
a source of teachers coming to the West and a destination for
Western travellers.

In the West today the various schools of Tibetan Buddhism
are all represented in Europe, the USA, Australia and New
Zealand. East Asian Buddhism is represented especially by Jap-
anese Zen in the USA and also in Europe; the Nichiren sub-
sect, Sdka Gakkai, is also a significant presence. The Theravada
presence takes the form of the Sangha from Sri Lanka and
South-East Asia and several samatha and vipassand meditation
schools and centres. There are also more eclectic groups, such
as the Western Buddhist Order, founded in 1967 by the English-
man Sangharakshita (Dennis Lingwood, b. 1925) who, having
been originally ordained as a Theravadin monk in India, came
to regard traditional Asian forms of Buddhist practice as inap-
propriate to the West.

The number of Westerners ordaining into the Theravada,
Tibetan, and East Asian Sanghas and living as monks both in
Asia and the West has increased significantly in the last twenty-
five years; in Buddhist circles in the West it is not uncommon to
find Westerners with thirty or forty years of involvement with
Buddhist practice behind them; some Westerners have gained
an authority as teachers which is recognized by Asian Buddhists.
The overall numbers of committed practitioners may still be
relatively small, but the growth of interest among Westerners in
Buddhism since the Second World War is a significant feature
of religious practice in the West.

276 Traditions of Buddhism

Nearly 2,500 years ago, ‘out of compassion for the world, for
the benefit and welfare of the many’, Buddhist monks began
their journey south to take the word of the Buddha across India.
Several centuries later their successors began to follow the long
trade routes east through central and South-East Asia into
China. Several centuries later still, monks crossed the mountain
passes to the north and entered Tibet. In India itself Buddhist
monasteries were gradually deserted and all that remained were
crumbling monuments to the past. The twentieth century has wit-
nessed the establishment of the Buddha’s word in the West and
the return of the Buddhist Sangha to its homeland in India.* And
despite ‘the killing fields’ of the Khmer Rouge and the ravages
of the Red Guard, the richness and diversity of Buddhism re-
mains: outside a cottage in the English countryside a small group
of people places food in the bowls of European and American
monks as they file past in silence; a hundred miles or so from the
place of the Buddha’s birth, pilgrims to the shrine of the primordial
Buddha Svayambhunatha in Nepal turn the countless prayer
wheels as they approach the great stiipa; in the hall of a
monastery situated amidst the rice fields of Korea a group of monks
sits silently in meditation; at Aukana in Sri Lanka a woman dressed
in white carefully places an open lotus bud at the feet of the giant
standing Buddha and raises her joined palms to her forehead.

The Foundations of

‘BUDDHISM

Rupert Gethin

The OPUS series provides concise
and original introductions to a
wide range of subjects.

‘The Buddhist way of meditation,
compassion and non-injury to
sentient beings is a deeply
attractive philosophy. This book
is the best available introduction.’

‘A hundred miles or so from the place
of the Buddha’s birth, pilgrims to the
shrine of the primordial Buddha
Svayambhunatha in Nepal turn the
countless prayer wheels as they
approach the great stiipa; in the hall of
amonastery situated amidst the rice
fields of Korea a group of monks sits
silently in meditation; at Aukana in Sri
Lanka a woman dressed in white
carefully places an open lotus bud at
the feet of the giant standing Buddha
and raises her joined palms to her
forehead.’

Buddhism is a vast and complex
religious and philosophical tradition
with a history that stretches back over
2,500 years. In this book, Rupert Gethin
investigates the common threads
connecting diverse traditions of
Buddhist thought and practice: the story
of the Buddha, the scriptural tradition of
his teachings, the four ‘noble truths’,
monastic and lay ways of life, karma and
rebirth, ethics, meditation, and
philosophy. While concentrating on the
formative phase of Buddhism in India,
he also considers the ways in which these
foundations have shaped the
development of Buddhism beyond India
and into the twentieth century.
